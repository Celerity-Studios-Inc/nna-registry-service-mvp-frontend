# Taxonomy Mapper Solution

## Problem Statement

The NNA Registry system was experiencing inconsistent display of dual addressing in the UI, particularly when showing NNA addresses in the success screen after asset creation. The issues included:

1. Some categories displayed as numeric codes (e.g., `W.002.FES.001`) instead of alphabetic codes (e.g., `W.STG.FES.001`) in the Human-Friendly Name (HFN).
2. Special cases like `S.POP.HPM` were handled inconsistently across components.
3. No single source of truth for taxonomy conversions across the application.
4. Redundant and inconsistent special-case handling in multiple components.

## Solution: Enhanced Taxonomy Mapper

We've implemented a comprehensive solution with a new `taxonomyMapper` module that serves as the single source of truth for all taxonomy conversions. This solution builds on the previous improvements made to the `codeMapping.enhanced.ts` module.

### Key Components

1. **`taxonomyMapper.ts`**: A new centralized mapping utility that:
   - Provides consistent bidirectional mapping between formats
   - Handles all special cases internally
   - Implements caching for performance optimization
   - Ensures HFN addresses always use alphabetic codes

2. **`normalizeAddressForDisplay`**: A new utility function that ensures addresses are always displayed in the correct format, particularly fixing cases where numeric codes might appear in HFN.

3. **Updated Components**:
   - `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`: Success screen now uses the enhanced mapper.
   - `NNAAddressPreview.tsx`: Preview component updated to use the enhanced mapper.
   - `ReviewSubmit.tsx`: Review component updated to use the enhanced mapper.

4. **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite to validate correct behavior.

## Key Fixes

1. **Numeric Category Fix**: The most visible issue was categories sometimes showing as numeric in the success screen. The `normalizeAddressForDisplay` function ensures HFN addresses always use alphabetic codes.

2. **Special Case Handling**: Special cases like `S.POP.HPM` and `W.HIP` (formerly `W.URB`) are now handled consistently through the mapper's cache and direct mappings.

3. **Performance Optimization**: The mapper implements a caching system to avoid redundant lookups and calculations.

4. **Single Source of Truth**: All components now use the same taxonomy mapper for consistent behavior.

5. **Type Safety**: All functions are properly typed for better code quality and developer experience.

## Technical Implementation

### Caching System

The mapper implements a sophisticated caching system with separate caches for different types of conversions:

```typescript
interface MappingCache {
  categoryNames: Map<string, string>;
  subcategoryNames: Map<string, string>;
  categoryAlphaCodes: Map<string, string>;
  subcategoryAlphaCodes: Map<string, string>;
  categoryNumericCodes: Map<string, number>;
  subcategoryNumericCodes: Map<string, number>;
  validCombinations: Map<string, boolean>;
  formatCache: Map<string, {hfn: string, mfa: string}>;
}
```

### Special Case Preloading

Known special cases are preloaded into the cache:

```typescript
private preloadSpecialCases(): void {
  // S.POP.HPM special case
  this.cache.subcategoryNumericCodes.set('S_POP_HPM', 7);
  this.cache.subcategoryAlphaCodes.set('S_001_007', 'HPM');
  this.cache.subcategoryAlphaCodes.set('S_POP_007', 'HPM');
  
  // W.URB/HIP special cases
  this.cache.categoryAlphaCodes.set('W_003', 'HIP');
  this.cache.categoryNumericCodes.set('W_HIP', 3);
}
```

### Address Normalization

The `normalizeAddressForDisplay` function ensures consistent display formats:

```typescript
normalizeAddressForDisplay(address: string, addressType: 'hfn' | 'mfa'): string {
  // Implementation ensures HFN always shows alphabetic codes
  // e.g., converts W.002.FES.001 to W.STG.FES.001
}
```

## Testing and Verification

The solution has been tested with various scenarios:

1. **S.POP.HPM Case**: Verified correct handling of the special Star/Pop/Hipster-Male combination.
2. **W.URB/HIP Case**: Verified correct handling of the World/Urban/Hipster category.
3. **Edge Cases**: Tested invalid inputs and boundary conditions.
4. **Performance**: Validated the caching mechanism works correctly.

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Addresses are now displayed consistently across all components.
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth makes future changes easier.
3. **Performance**: Caching improves performance for repeated operations.
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive test suite ensures correct behavior.
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear, well-documented API for taxonomy conversions.

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Format an address consistently
const { hfn, mfa } = taxonomyMapper.formatNNAAddress(
  'S',
  'POP', 
  'HPM',
  '001'
);
// hfn: "S.POP.HPM.001"
// mfa: "2.001.007.001"

// Ensure HFN always uses alphabetic codes
const normalizedHfn = taxonomyMapper.normalizeAddressForDisplay('W.002.FES.001', 'hfn');
// normalizedHfn: "W.STG.FES.001"
```

## Conclusion

This solution provides a comprehensive fix for the taxonomy display issues. By implementing a centralized mapper with consistent behavior and proper caching, we've addressed both the immediate display issues and created a more maintainable architecture for handling taxonomy conversions in the future.
