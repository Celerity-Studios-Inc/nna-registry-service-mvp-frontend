// This file exports all layer lookup tables
// Initially, we'll manually export the W layer (after running the flattener)
// Later, we'll add other layers as they are generated

// Layer exports will be added after running the flattener
export * from './W_layer'; // This will be available after running the flattener script
// export * from './G_layer';
// export * from './S_layer';
// etc.
