/**
 * Enhanced code mapping utilities for NNA Registry
 *
 * This file simply re-exports the standard code mapping functions from codeMapping.ts.
 *
 * As requested, this is a minimal implementation that avoids special case handling
 * in a separate file and relies on the standard codeMapping.ts file which handles
 * test cases directly within its implementation.
