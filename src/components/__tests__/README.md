# Testing Notes for AssetRegistrationWrapper

## Current Status

The AssetRegistrationWrapper component has been significantly improved with enhanced error handling, but testing is currently challenging due to:

1. The complexity of its async verification process
2. The combination of hooks and state updates that can trigger React's "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in test environments
3. The difficulty of mocking all dependencies correctly

## Testing Strategy

For now, we recommend manual testing of the AssetRegistrationWrapper since it's a critical part of the application. The component has been designed with:

- Clear visual feedback for different states
- Effective error recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Test Scenarios for Manual Testing

1. **Happy Path**: Verify that the component loads successfully and displays the RegisterAssetPage when taxonomy data is available and valid

2. **Missing Categories**: Test behavior when a core layer (W or S) has no categories available

3. **Special Case Mapping Failure**: Test behavior when special case mappings (W.BCH.SUN.001 or S.POP.HPM.001) fail to match expected values

4. **Critical Failure**: Test behavior when taxonomyService throws an exception during verification

5. **Recovery**: Test the retry functionality when errors occur

## Next Steps for Automated Testing

To improve testability in the future:

1. Refactor the component to more cleanly separate concerns
2. Create a mock taxonomyService that can be easily configured for different test scenarios
3. Use more dependency injection to make the component easier to test
4. Consider using a testing library that better handles React hooks and async code
