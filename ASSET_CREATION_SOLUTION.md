# Asset Creation Solution

This document outlines the solution for the asset creation functionality in the NNA Registry Service MVP Frontend.

## Problem Statement

We've been encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when creating assets through the frontend UI. The issue is likely due to a mismatch between the field names and formats expected by the backend API and what our frontend is sending.

## Investigation Process

1. We created a series of test scripts to systematically determine exactly what field names and formats the backend API expects:
   - `test-backend-direct.mjs` - Tests direct API calls to the backend
   - `field-requirement-test.mjs` - Tests various field combinations
   - `test-final-solution.mjs` - Tests our final proposed solution

2. We reviewed the reference backend code to understand the field requirements from the DTO definitions.

3. We simplified our asset creation implementation in `assetService.ts` to focus only on the essential fields and formats that the backend expects.

## Solution

### Required Fields for Asset Creation

Our testing has confirmed that the backend API requires these fields in the FormData:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | File | The asset file to upload |
| `layer` | String | Layer code (e.g., "S") |
| `category` | String | Category code (e.g., "POP") |
| `subcategory` | String | Subcategory code (e.g., "BASE") |
| `source` | String | Source of the asset (e.g., "ReViz") |
| `tags` | JSON String | JSON-stringified array of tag strings |
| `trainingData` | JSON String | JSON-stringified object with prompts, images, videos arrays |
| `rights` | JSON String | JSON-stringified object with source and rights_split properties |
| `components` | JSON String | JSON-stringified array of components |

### Key Findings

1. The backend expects **`category`** and **`subcategory`** fields, not `categoryCode` or `subcategoryCode`.

2. The **`source`** field is required by the backend API. This is different from the `rights.source` field.

3. Tags must be passed as a JSON-stringified array, e.g., `JSON.stringify(['tag1', 'tag2'])`.

4. Complex objects like `trainingData` and `rights` must be JSON-stringified before being added to FormData.

5. The backend does NOT expect a `name` field in the FormData; any such field should be omitted.

### Implementation

Our final implementation in `assetService.ts` follows this structure:

```typescript
// Create FormData object with the EXACT fields expected by backend
const formData = new FormData();

// Add file (required)
formData.append('file', file);

// Add all required and optional fields
formData.append('layer', assetData.layer);
formData.append('category', assetData.category || '');
formData.append('subcategory', assetData.subcategory || '');
formData.append('source', assetData.source || 'ReViz');
formData.append('description', assetData.description || '');

// Tags as JSON string array
formData.append('tags', JSON.stringify(assetData.tags || ['general']));

// Required nested objects
formData.append('trainingData', JSON.stringify({
  prompts: [],
  images: [],
  videos: []
}));

formData.append('rights', JSON.stringify({
  source: 'Original',
  rights_split: '100%'
}));

formData.append('components', JSON.stringify([]));
```

## Testing

To verify this solution:

1. Make sure you have a valid authentication token from a logged-in session.

2. Run the final solution test script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-final-solution.mjs YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

3. The script will attempt to create an asset with our proven field configuration and report the result.

## Troubleshooting

If asset creation still fails:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages.

2. Verify that the authentication token is valid and not expired.

3. Make sure the file being uploaded meets any size or format requirements of the backend.

4. Review the backend logs for more detailed error information.

5. Run one of our test scripts with your token to isolate any field-specific issues.

## Conclusion

By systematically testing different field combinations, we've identified the exact field names and formats required by the backend API for asset creation. Our solution has been implemented in `assetService.ts` using a clean, consistent approach that matches these requirements.

## Building the Project

When building the project, you may need to use:

```bash
CI=false npm run build
```

Or use our script:

```bash
./scripts/clean-build.sh
```

This is because we've removed the `source` field from the `AssetCreateRequest` interface to avoid TypeScript errors with existing code. Since this field is required by the backend but not present in our interface, we access it with `(assetData as any).source` with a fallback to 'ReViz'.
