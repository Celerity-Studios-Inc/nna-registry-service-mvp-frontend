echo "To manually test the implementation, follow these steps:"
echo
echo "1. Start the frontend application:"

echo "   - S.POP.LGF should display correctly despite backend normalization to BAS"
echo "   - S.POP.ICM should display correctly despite backend normalization to BAS"
echo
echo "5. Check console logs for detailed debugging information about the code normalization process"
