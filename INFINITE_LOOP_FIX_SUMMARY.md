# NNA Registry Service Frontend Fixes Summary

## Infinite Loop Fix (2024-05-17)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Infinite Rendering Loop** - Fixed a critical issue where the application would enter an infinite rendering cycle, especially when selecting a layer in the asset registration process.
2. **Disappearing Categories** - Categories would briefly appear and then disappear repeatedly in the UI.
3. **Excessive Console Logs** - Repeated logs of "Direct navigation to Register Asset - clearing stored data" and "Setting layer to S".
4. **Performance Issues** - The infinite loop caused significant performance degradation.

### Technical Details

#### Root Causes
1. **Circular State Updates** in SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2 component
   - Component was both updating internal state and triggering parent callbacks on prop changes
   - This created a cycle: props change → update state → call parent → parent updates props → repeat

2. **Inefficient Session Storage Access** in RegisterAssetPage
   - Session storage operations were happening on every render
   - Each storage operation triggered state changes causing re-renders

3. **Suboptimal Effect Dependencies** in useTaxonomy hook
   - Effect dependencies included arrays that would cause unnecessary re-renders
   - Missing optimization to prevent duplicate state updates

#### Implemented Fixes

1. **SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2.tsx**
   - Removed parent callback calls from useEffect hooks to break circular state updates
   - Added checks to prevent duplicate state updates in event handlers
   - Optimized layer selection and initialization logic

2. **RegisterAssetPage.tsx**
   - Added a React ref to track if navigation state has been checked
   - Moved session storage operations to useEffect that runs only once
   - Improved initialization process to avoid repeated checks

3. **useTaxonomy.ts**
   - Removed unnecessary dependencies from useEffect to avoid excessive re-renders
   - Added duplicate selection prevention in callback functions
   - Improved error handling and recovery logic

### Results
- The application now renders efficiently without infinite loops
- Categories persist in the UI after selection
- Console logs are no longer flooded with repeated messages
- Performance is significantly improved
- All error handling and recovery mechanisms are preserved

### Verification
- Manually tested the asset registration flow
- Confirmed that layers and categories display correctly
- Verified that the application performs well without console log flooding

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing a more robust state management system
- Add comprehensive integration tests to catch similar issues
- Implement a TaxonomyContext to ensure consistent state across components
