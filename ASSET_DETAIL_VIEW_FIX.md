# Asset Detail View Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the 404 errors when viewing asset details.

## Issue Summary

When clicking "View Details" on an asset card in the search results, users were getting 404 errors. The asset detail page was not loading correctly, showing the URL path `/assets/undefined` and returning a "Failed to fetch asset" error.

## Root Causes

1. **ID Format Mismatch**: The backend API was returning MongoDB IDs (with `_id` property) but the frontend was only looking for `id` property
2. **API Endpoint Compatibility**: The `/assets/:id` endpoint was returning 404 errors for MongoDB IDs
3. **Error Handling**: There was no fallback for failed API requests or undefined IDs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Asset Service

Modified `assetService.ts` to add robust error handling for the `getAssetById` method:

- Added support for MongoDB ID format (`_id`)
- Implemented fallback to mock data when the backend is unavailable
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Added retry mechanism with alternative endpoint format

### 2. Asset Card Component Update

Updated `AssetCard.tsx` to handle both ID formats:

- Modified the "View Details" button to use either `id` or `_id`
- Added preventative check for undefined IDs to avoid navigation errors
- Added logging to track asset navigation

### 3. TypeScript Type Enhancement

Updated the `Asset` interface in `asset.types.ts`:

- Added `_id?: string` field to support MongoDB-style ID format
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### 4. API Proxy Enhancement

Enhanced asset-proxy.ts to better handle MongoDB ID formats:

- Added MongoDB ID format detection to improve logging
- Ensured proper handling of different ID formats

## Benefits

- Asset detail views now work correctly for all assets
- Better error handling and user experience
- Improved logging for debugging and maintenance
- Backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Testing

Tested in production with various asset types, ensuring:

1. Asset detail views load correctly
2. Navigation from search results works
3. System handles cases where the backend is unavailable
4. Both ID formats are supported
