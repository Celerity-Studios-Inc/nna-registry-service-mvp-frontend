# UI Rollback with Enhanced Taxonomy

## Overview

This branch represents a selective rollback of UI components to a stable state while preserving the enhancements made to the taxonomy mapping system. This approach allows us to maintain the critical fixes for special case mappings (like S.POP.HPM.001 → 2.001.007.001) while reverting UI components that were causing rendering issues.

## Changes Included

### Preserved from Recent Development
1. **Enhanced Taxonomy Mapping**
   - Fixed flattened taxonomy lookup tables
   - Critical S.POP.HPM.001 → 2.001.007.001 mapping fix
   - All taxonomy mapping code in src/api/taxonomyMapper.ts
   - Constants and lookup tables in src/taxonomyLookup/

2. **Fixed UI Components**
   - Optimized SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2.tsx with infinite loop fixes
   - Fixed RegisterAssetPage sessionStorage handling
   - Optimized useTaxonomy hook to prevent circular updates

### UI Components
- Retained ErrorBoundary for better error handling
- Maintained FeedbackContext for user notifications
- Fixed AssetRegistrationWrapper with proper initialization
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

## Testing Instructions

1. **Verify Layer Display**
   - Layer cards should display properly
   - Layer selection should work with single or double click

2. **Verify Category/Subcategory Display**
   - Categories should load and remain visible after selection
   - Subcategories should load correctly when a category is selected

3. **Verify Special Case Mappings**
   - W.BCH.SUN.001 should map to 5.004.003.001
   - S.POP.HPM.001 should map to 2.001.007.001

## Implementation Notes

This branch was created through a selective combination approach:
1. Started from a stable UI commit (96d6f0d - "Add useTaxonomy hook")
2. Brought forward the enhanced taxonomy mapping components
3. Applied the infinite loop fixes to the UI components
4. Ensured all critical taxonomy files are included

Once testing confirms the UI is working correctly with the enhanced taxonomy system, this branch can be merged back to main.
