# Build Fix for React Hook Error

## Problem

The CI/CD build (commit ce072b3) was failing with the following error:

```
[eslint] 
src/pages/RegisterAssetPage.tsx
  Line 930:36:  React Hook "React.useCallback" is called in function "getStepContent" that is neither a React function component nor a custom React Hook function. React component names must start with an uppercase letter. React Hook names must start with the word "use"  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
```

This is because React Hooks must be called at the top level of a function component, not inside nested functions like `getStepContent`.

## Solution

1. Created a dedicated handler function at the top level of the component using React.useCallback:
   ```javascript
   // Handle subcategory selection for SimpleTaxonomySelectionV3 component
   const handleSubcategorySelectV3 = React.useCallback(async (subcategoryCode: string) => {
     // Function implementation
   }, [watchLayer, watch, setValue, setLoading]);
   ```

2. Updated the component to use this handler:
   ```javascript
   <SimpleTaxonomySelectionV3
     // Other props
     onSubcategorySelect={handleSubcategorySelectV3}
   />
   ```

3. Fixed related TypeScript errors:
   - Updated the taxonomyFixValidator.ts file to remove unsafe access to setValue
   - Fixed type casting for the validateTaxonomyFix function
   - Updated the enhancedTaxonomyService.ts file to use the flattened taxonomy correctly
   - Fixed incorrect path from '../flattened_taxonomy/constants' to '../taxonomyLookup/constants'
   - Updated the getLayers and getCategories functions to work with the flattened taxonomy

## Additional Fixes

1. Fixed incompatible type issues with React Hook Form's setValue function by creating a properly typed wrapper function:
   ```javascript
   const setValueAny = (name: string, value: any) => setValue(name as any, value);
   ```

2. Removed references to the removed taxonomyData object in enhancedTaxonomyService.ts.

The build now completes successfully with some warnings, but no errors.
