# GitHub Workflow Fixes

## Issue Summary
The CI/CD pipeline was showing git-related warnings with exit code 128:

```
Build and Test
The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128

Deploy to Vercel
The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Authentication Issues**: The GitHub Action workflows were attempting git operations without proper authentication.
2. **Outdated Actions**: Some of the actions were using older versions (v2) that might not be compatible with the latest GitHub environment.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Explicit Token Authentication
Added explicit token authentication to the checkout actions in CI/CD workflow:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This ensures that git operations have the necessary permissions to execute.

### 2. Updated Actions to Latest Versions
Updated the Node.js setup action from v2 to v4:

```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```

### 3. Standardized Checkout Configuration
Ensured consistent checkout configuration across all workflows:
- Used a consistent naming convention for checkout steps
- Set fetch-depth to 0 to get complete history
- Explicitly added the GitHub token for authentication

## Testing and Verification
These changes should resolve the git-related warnings in the CI/CD pipeline. The next push to the repository will trigger the workflows with the updated configuration, which can be monitored to verify the fixes.

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider setting up workflow concurrency limits to prevent multiple workflows from running simultaneously on the same ref
2. Add workflow status badges to the README.md for better visibility
3. Review and update other GitHub Actions to their latest versions for security and feature improvements
