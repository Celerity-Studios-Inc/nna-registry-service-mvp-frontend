# W.BCH.SUN Mapping Fix

## Overview

This document describes a minimal, targeted fix for the W.BCH.SUN taxonomy mapping issue. The problem is that W.BCH.SUN currently maps to an incorrect MFA (Machine-Friendly Address) code of 77 instead of the correct 003.

## Implementation Approach

We've implemented a focused fix that targets only the specific W.BCH.SUN case without introducing large-scale changes to the existing taxonomy mapping system. The fix is implemented in the `api/taxonomyMapper.ts` file.

### Fix Details

1. **Explicit Special Case Handling**:
   Added a direct special case for W.BCH.SUN in the `getSubcategoryNumericCode` method:
   
   ```typescript
   // Special case for W.BCH.SUN
   if (layerCode === 'W' && categoryCode === 'BCH' && subcategoryStr === 'SUN') {
     return 3;
   }
   ```

2. **UI Feedback**:
   Added an informational alert in the TaxonomySelection component to make users aware of this special case:
   
   ```tsx
   {/* Special case alert for W.BCH.SUN */}
   {layerCode === 'W' && selectedCategoryCode === 'BCH' && selectedSubcategoryCode === 'SUN' && (
     <Alert severity="info" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
       <AlertTitle>Special Case</AlertTitle>
       This is using a special mapping: W.BCH.SUN â†’ 5.004.003
     </Alert>
   )}
   ```

## Testing

The fix has been validated with the following test cases:

- W.BCH.SUN.001 now correctly maps to 5.004.003.001
- Other taxonomy mappings are unaffected
- The UI correctly displays an informational alert

## Why This Approach?

We chose this minimal approach because:

1. It addresses the specific issue without introducing broader changes that could have unintended consequences
2. It maintains compatibility with the existing codebase
3. It's simple to implement, test, and roll back if needed

This targeted fix ensures that W.BCH.SUN combinations are correctly mapped to the appropriate numeric code 003 while preserving the existing functionality for all other taxonomy mappings.
