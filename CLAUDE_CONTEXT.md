# NNA Registry Service MVP Frontend Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a frontend application for the NNA Registry Service, which handles the management of digital assets within a Naming, Numbering, and Addressing (NNA) Framework. The application implements a dual addressing system (Human-Friendly Names and Machine-Friendly Addresses) for digital assets across various layers.

## Recent Progress

We have completed Steps 1-5 of implementing improvements to the taxonomy handling system in the application:

### Step 1: Taxonomy Service Initialization System
- Created a robust taxonomy service initialization system to ensure proper loading of taxonomy data
- Implemented waitForTaxonomyInit functionality for components to wait for data to be available
- Added validation of critical mappings (e.g., W.BCH.SUN.001 → 5.004.003.001)
- Created TaxonomyInitProvider component to wrap the application

### Step 2: useTaxonomy Hook
- Created a comprehensive hook for accessing taxonomy data
- Implemented loading states, error handling, and retry mechanisms
- Added fallback data for critical taxonomies
- Provided an API for layer, category, and subcategory selection

### Step 3: Refactored LayerSelector Component
- Created LayerSelectorV2 using the useTaxonomy hook
- Improved UI/UX with better feedback and layout
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added comprehensive tests

### Step 4: Refactored Taxonomy Selection Component
- Created SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2 component using the useTaxonomy hook
- Improved loading and error states
- Added retry functionality for data loading
- Created comprehensive tests

### Step 5: Enhanced Error Handling and Feedback
- Created FeedbackContext for global feedback management
- Implemented FeedbackDisplay component for showing feedback messages
- Created ErrorBoundary for catching component errors
- Updated useTaxonomy to provide user-friendly feedback
- Added comprehensive styles for feedback and error components

## TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error related to LAYER_NUMERIC_CODES access in RegisterAssetPage.tsx
- Updated to use taxonomyService.getLayerNumericCode() instead of direct constant access

## Current Status
All changes have been committed and pushed to the GitHub repository. We're ready to proceed with Step 6.

## Next Steps
Step 6 will focus on additional enhancements to improve the user experience and fix any remaining issues with the taxonomy system.

## Technical Notes
- The project uses React with TypeScript
- Material UI is used for component styling
- We're using a flattened taxonomy approach with lookup tables
- We have implemented our own error handling and feedback systems
- There are several special case mappings we need to handle (e.g., W.BCH.SUN.001 → 5.004.003.001)

## Shell Command Issues
In the previous session, we experienced issues with shell commands not executing properly. We started a new session to resolve these issues.
