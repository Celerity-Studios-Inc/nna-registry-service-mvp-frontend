# Asset Search and Display Fix

## Issues Identified
1. Asset previews not displaying properly for some assets in the grid view
2. "View Details" not working reliably for all assets
3. Search functionality not finding assets with matching tags or taxonomy fields
4. MongoDB ID handling issues causing 404 errors in asset detail views

## Solutions Implemented

### Asset Preview Fix
Enhanced the FilePreview component to:
- Better handle different URL and file formats used by the backend
- Add more robust URL extraction logic to find valid file URLs
- Implement comprehensive checks for various URL formats
- Add fallback mechanisms when expected properties are missing

```typescript
// Special case for MongoDB's format in DB responses (gcpStorageUrl is common)
if (typeof file === 'object' && file \!== null && 'gcpStorageUrl' in file) {
  const url = file.gcpStorageUrl;
  if (url) {
    console.log("Setting object URL from gcpStorageUrl:", url);
    setObjectUrl(url);
    return;
  }
}
```

### Search Functionality Fix
Improved the asset search to:
- Handle different tag formats (arrays, strings, objects)
- Expand search to include more relevant fields (categories, subcategories, addresses)
- Add detailed logging for troubleshooting specific search terms
- Fix tag matching which was a common source of missed results

```typescript
// Improved tag matching - handle both string arrays and array-like objects
let tagMatch = false;

if (asset.tags) {
  // Handle tags as an array of strings (most common format)
  if (Array.isArray(asset.tags)) {
    tagMatch = asset.tags.some(tag => 
      typeof tag === 'string' && tag.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
    );
  } 
  // Handle other formats...
}
```

### Asset Detail View Fix
Fixed MongoDB ID handling to ensure asset detail views load correctly:
- Updated asset-proxy.ts to properly rewrite MongoDB ID endpoints
- Enhanced assetService.getAssetById to handle both regular and MongoDB ID formats
- Improved error handling and added detailed logging

## Testing 
This fix should address:
1. Missing previews in the asset grid
2. "View Details" navigation issues
3. Search results not matching expected assets
4. The 404 errors when viewing asset details

## Notes
- Taxonomy warnings in the console are still present but don't affect functionality
- These fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing code patterns
- Added extensive logging to help diagnose any remaining issues
