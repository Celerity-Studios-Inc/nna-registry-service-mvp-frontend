# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

I've implemented the Persisting Intermediate State functionality to enhance the asset registration workflow. Here's what's been done:

1. Created `SelectionStorage` utility (`src/utils/selectionStorage.ts`):
   - Provides methods for saving, retrieving, updating, and clearing taxonomy selections
   - Uses sessionStorage for persistence
   - Includes automatic handling of stale data
   - Supports multiple forms through the formId parameter

2. Enhanced `RegisterAssetPageNew` component:
   - Added automatic saving of selections during navigation and when user makes choices
   - Implemented auto-restoration of previously saved selections on return to the form
   - Added navigation warnings when user attempts to leave with unsaved changes
   - Ensured proper cleanup of saved data after successful form submission

3. Integrated with `EventCoordinator` for reliable state sequencing:
   - Used to ensure operations happen in the correct order during state restoration
   - Prevents race conditions when loading taxonomy data
   - Provides fallback mechanisms when primary data loading fails

4. Added tests and documentation:
   - Created `taxonomyStateRestoration.test.ts` to verify state persistence functionality
   - Added detailed documentation in `SELECTION_STORAGE_DOCS.md`
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with information about the implementation

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users no longer lose their selections when navigating away or refreshing the page
2. **Reduced Data Loss**: Progress is automatically saved at key points in the workflow
3. **Navigation Warnings**: Users are warned before accidentally leaving the page with unsaved changes
4. **Reliable State Restoration**: Multi-tiered approach ensures selections are properly restored
5. **Simplified Development**: Clear API for managing persistent state across page loads

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- Saving and retrieving taxonomy selections
- Proper sequencing of restoration operations
- Correct handling of stale data
- Cleanup after form submission
- Navigation warning functionality

## Next Steps

Possible future enhancements:
1. Extend persistence to include file selections and other form fields
2. Add cross-tab synchronization using the Storage event
3. Consider backend persistence for mission-critical forms (would require authentication)
4. Add compression for larger form data
5. Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms

All changes have been committed to GitHub for review.
