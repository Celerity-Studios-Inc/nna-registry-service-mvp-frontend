# NNA Registry Service Frontend - Deployment Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses two key deployment issues:

1. **CORS Issues**: Fixed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when the frontend deployed on Vercel tries to access the backend API.
2. **CI/CD Automation**: Set up GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployment to Vercel.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CORS Solution (TypeScript-based API Proxy)

We implemented a three-part approach to solve CORS issues:

#### a. TypeScript Serverless Function (`api/proxy.ts`)

Created a TypeScript-based Vercel serverless function that:
- Properly handles CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests
- Forwards all API requests to the backend with appropriate headers
- Adds necessary CORS headers to responses
- Handles different request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Includes error handling and proper TypeScript types

#### b. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

Updated the Vercel configuration to:
- Route all `/api/*` requests through our proxy function
- Set proper environment variables for production
- Configure the correct framework and build settings

#### c. API Client Updates (`src/api/api.ts`)

The API client was already correctly using relative URLs:
- Using `/api` as the baseURL
- This works seamlessly with our proxy approach

### 2. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow was already correctly implemented:
- Triggers on push to main branch
- Sets up Node.js and installs dependencies
- Builds the application
- Sets proper environment variables
- Deploys to Vercel with the appropriate secrets

## Dependencies Added

- `node-fetch`: For making HTTP requests in the serverless function
- `@types/node-fetch`: TypeScript type definitions for node-fetch
- `@vercel/node`: TypeScript types for Vercel serverless functions

## Testing and Verification

To verify the implementation:
1. Push changes to the main branch to trigger deployment
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow execution
3. Verify the deployed application communicates with the backend without CORS errors
4. Monitor Vercel logs for any issues

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes:
- Proper handling of request headers
- Sanitization of response headers
- Error handling to prevent information leakage

## Further Improvements

For future consideration:
- Add caching to improve performance
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add more detailed logging for troubleshooting
