# Session Summary for Next Session

## Project Context
- Working on the NNA Registry Service with frontend and backend components
- Fixed backend subcategory normalization issue in taxonomy.service.ts
- Created deployment and testing scripts to verify the fix

## Key Issues Addressed
1. **Backend Subcategory Normalization Issue**:
   - Backend was normalizing subcategories to "Base" (BAS) 
   - Only S.POP.HPM combinations were preserved correctly
   - Fixed by implementing proper code mapping tables and bidirectional lookups

2. **Frontend Sequential Numbering**:
   - Fixed issues with MFA (Machine-Friendly Address) sequential numbering
   - Implemented special handling for S.POP.HPM taxonomy path
   - Enhanced preview and display components

## Deployment Status
- Updated GitHub Actions CI/CD to include stable-backend-new-key branch
- Manually deployed changes to verify fixes
- Created test scripts to verify backend responses

## Rollback Analysis
- Recommended rollback to commit e02a8e8 (tagged as taxonomy-fixes-v1.0)
- This commit includes sequential numbering fixes and detailed documentation
- Represents stable state before backend modifications

## Next Steps
1. Complete rollback to e02a8e8 if needed
2. Test frontend with fixed backend to ensure compatibility
3. Verify both subcategory normalization and sequential numbering work correctly
4. Consider merging stable fixes back to main branch

## Documentation
- Created multiple documentation files detailing fixes:
  - STATUS_REPORT.md: Overview of frontend fixes and backend issues
  - TAXONOMY_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Details on taxonomy compatibility fixes
  - TAXONOMY_SUBCATEGORY_FIX.md: Implementation details of subcategory fix
  - MFA_DISPLAY_FIX.md: Fixes for MFA display issues
  - MFA_ADDRESS_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Summary of addressing fixes

This summary will help us quickly resume work in the next session.
