This file is created to ensure a fresh build and deployment on Vercel after the recent fixes.

## Recent Fixes Summary
1. Fixed critical taxonomy mapping issues that were causing Vercel build errors
2. Fixed incorrect import patterns in taxonomyMapper.ts

4. Fixed test files with syntax errors and ESLint violations

## Deployment Information
