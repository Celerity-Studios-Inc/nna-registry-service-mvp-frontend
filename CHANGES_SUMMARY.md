- Updated manifest.json app name to "NNA Registry Service"
- Created test page (logo-test.html) to verify images

## 2. Updated asset creation implementation
- Fixed field naming to match backend API expectations
- Changed from `categoryCode`/`subcategoryCode` to `category`/`subcategory`
- Properly formatted tags as JSON-stringified array
- Updated "components" field to use JSON-stringified empty array
- Added proper subcategory validation for S/POP taxonomy combinations

## 3. Enhanced type definitions

## 4. Created test scripts
- Updated test-final-solution.mjs to test the proper field formats

## 5. UI Improvements (Latest)
- **Consistent Sequential Number Display**
  - Updated `ReviewSubmit.tsx` to display ".000" as a placeholder for sequence numbers in both HFN and MFA displays
  - This ensures consistency with the preview shown in the TaxonomySelection step
  - Both Human-Friendly Names (HFN) and Machine-Friendly Addresses (MFA) now consistently display with ".000" in the final review stage

- **Layer Name Display Improvements**
  - Added full layer name displays across multiple components:
    - `TaxonomySelection.tsx` (Step 2): Shows the full layer name with code in parentheses (e.g., "Stars (S)")
    - `FileUpload.tsx` (Step 3): Added the same format layer name display for better context
    - Asset Created Success Screen: Updated to show full layer names instead of just codes
  - This provides better context throughout the asset registration workflow

- **Implementation Details**
  - Added layer name mapping from codes to full names (G → Songs, S → Stars, etc.)
  - Used consistent styling for the layer name displays across components
  - Ensured fallback displays if a layer code doesn't have a mapped name
  - These changes improve user understanding and workflow clarity
