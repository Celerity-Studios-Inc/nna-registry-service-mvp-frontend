# NNA Registry Frontend Status Report

## Date: May 11, 2025

## Current Status

The NNA Registry Service frontend has undergone significant fixes to address several critical issues related to asset registration and taxonomy display. This document serves as a checkpoint and detailed summary of the current state.

## Resolved Issues

1. **Sequential Numbering Display**
   - Fixed issues with the HFN (Human-Friendly Name) and MFA (Machine-Friendly Address) sequential numbering 
   - Implemented special handling for S.POP.HPM taxonomy path
   - Ensured consistent display of sequential numbers across the workflow

2. **Success Screen Display**
   - Fixed success screen to display correct HFN and MFA from backend response
   - Added multiple fallback mechanisms for image preview
   - Enhanced error handling for file display

3. **Taxonomy Selection**
   - Fixed TaxonomySelection component to maintain sequential numbering
   - Implemented special case handling for S.POP.HPM to ensure correct MFA display
   - Modified codeMapping.ts to allow flexible sequential numbers

4. **Preview Stability**
   - Fixed NNAAddressPreview to show consistent values during asset registration process
   - Added direct MFA construction for special taxonomy cases

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Backend Taxonomy Mapping**
   - **Issue**: Backend normalizes most subcategories to "Base" (BAS)
     - When selecting non-HPM subcategories (LGF, LGM, DIV, IDF), the backend converts them to BAS
     - Only S.POP.HPM is preserved properly as selected
   - **Example**: 
     - User selects: S.POP.LGF.001 (Stars/Pop/Legend Female)
     - Backend returns: S.POP.BAS.008 with S.001.001.008
   - **Status**: This is a backend issue requiring changes to the backend validation/normalization logic

## Implementation Details

The following key components were modified to fix the frontend issues:

1. **RegisterAssetPage.tsx**
   - Now directly uses backend values for HFN/MFA in success screen
   - Added enhanced file preview with better fallback mechanisms
   - Improved error handling for image loading failures

2. **TaxonomySelection.tsx**
   - Updated to use correct sequential numbers in MFA
   - Added special handling for S.POP.HPM case
   - Improved logging and validation

3. **codeMapping.ts**
   - Modified to allow flexible sequential numbers
   - Added special handling for S.POP.HPM case

4. **taxonomyService.ts**
   - Fixed counter incrementing behavior
   - Added proper sequential number handling

5. **NNAAddressPreview.tsx**
   - Added direct handling for special taxonomy cases

## Sequential Number Behavior

- The backend maintains separate sequential counters for each taxonomy path
- S.POP.HPM assets are currently at sequence .009
- S.POP.BAS assets are currently at sequence .008
- New unique taxonomy paths start at .001

## Testing Results

Extensive testing confirmed:
1. Asset registration works for all taxonomy combinations
2. Sequential numbering increments correctly per taxonomy path
3. Success screen displays correct values from backend
4. Image preview works consistently

However, testing also revealed that the backend normalizes subcategories:
- S.POP.HPM → remains S.POP.HPM (preserved)
- S.POP.LGM → becomes S.POP.BAS
- S.POP.LGF → becomes S.POP.BAS
- S.POP.DIV → becomes S.POP.BAS
- S.POP.IDF → becomes S.POP.BAS

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Investigation and Fix**
   - Examine backend code to understand subcategory normalization
   - Update backend to preserve selected subcategories
   - Alternative: Add warning to frontend if backend behavior cannot be changed

2. **Potential Duplicate Asset Detection**
   - Feature to detect similar assets after creation
   - Display notice on success screen
   - Provide tools to compare and manage duplicates

## Technical Notes

The frontend is now correctly handling whatever values the backend returns. The final step is to address the backend's normalization of subcategories.
