# IMMEDIATE THREE-TIER WORKFLOW FIX

**CRITICAL**: Current deployment violates three-tier best practices  
**ACTION REQUIRED**: Implement proper dev‚Üístaging‚Üíprod workflow immediately

---

## üö® **CURRENT PROBLEM**

### **Issue**: Frontend pushing directly to `main` branch causing:
- Automatic deployment to ALL environments simultaneously
- No approval gates or quality control
- Bypass of proper testing isolation
- Violation of three-tier promotion best practices

### **Current Deployment Status**
```
CI/CD #16100829858: "üîÑ TAXONOMY SYNC ACTIVATION" 
Status: Deployed to all environments without proper testing
```

---

## ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE FIX IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Step 1: Create Proper Branch Structure**
```bash
# Create development branch from current state
git checkout -b development
git push -u origin development

# Create staging branch  
git checkout main
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging

# Protect main branch
# (Done via GitHub settings)
```

### **Step 2: GitHub Branch Protection Setup**
**Branch Protection Rules for `main`**:
- [x] Require pull request reviews (2 approvers)
- [x] Require status checks to pass
- [x] Require branches to be up to date
- [x] Require signed commits
- [x] Include administrators in restrictions

**Branch Protection Rules for `staging`**:
- [x] Require pull request reviews (1 approver)
- [x] Require status checks to pass
- [x] Allow force pushes by administrators only

### **Step 3: Update Vercel Project Configuration**
```
Development Environment:
- Branch: development
- URL: nna-registry-frontend-dev.vercel.app
- Auto-deploy: YES

Staging Environment:  
- Branch: staging
- URL: nna-registry-frontend-stg.vercel.app
- Auto-deploy: YES (on PR merge)

Production Environment:
- Branch: main  
- URL: nna-registry-frontend.vercel.app
- Auto-deploy: YES (on PR merge with approval)
```

### **Step 4: Create GitHub Actions Workflows**

**Development Auto-Deploy** (`.github/workflows/development-deploy.yml`):
```yaml
name: Development Auto-Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [development]
jobs:
  deploy-development:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: CI=false npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Development
        uses: vercel/action@v1
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DEV }}
```

**Staging Promotion** (`.github/workflows/staging-promotion.yml`):
```yaml
name: Staging Promotion
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [staging]
    types: [closed]
jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        uses: vercel/action@v1
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STG }}
```

**Production Release** (`.github/workflows/production-release.yml`):
```yaml
name: Production Release
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [closed]
jobs:
  deploy-production:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Create Release Tag
        run: |
          git tag v$(date +%Y.%m.%d)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
          git push origin --tags
      - name: Deploy to Production
        uses: vercel/action@v1
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

## üîÑ **NEW WORKFLOW PROCESS**

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop and test
# ... make changes ...
npm run build
npm run test

# 3. Push to development
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR to development branch
# Auto-deploy to dev environment on merge
```

### **Staging Promotion**
```bash
# 1. Validate development environment
# 2. Create staging promotion PR
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

# 3. Create PR: development ‚Üí staging
# 4. Team lead approval required
# 5. Auto-deploy to staging on merge
```

### **Production Release**
```bash
# 1. Validate staging environment
# 2. Create production release PR
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Create PR: staging ‚Üí main
# 4. Senior approval required
# 5. Auto-deploy to production on merge
# 6. Release tag created automatically
```
