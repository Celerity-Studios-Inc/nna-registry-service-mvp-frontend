# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Conditional React Hook Calls**
   - Fixed React Hooks rule violations in taxonomy components where hooks were being called after conditional returns
   - Affected components: LayerGrid.tsx, CategoryGrid.tsx, SubcategoryGrid.tsx
   - Solution: Reorganized code to ensure all hooks are called unconditionally at the top level

2. **Component Structure Issues**
   - Fixed RegisterAssetPageNew.tsx component structure with proper React.memo usage
   - Fixed FileUpload.tsx component structure by correctly applying React.memo

3. **Missing Adapter Functions**
   - Added missing handler functions for the TaxonomySelector component
   - Fixed dependency arrays in useCallback hooks to prevent build errors

## Verification

- Build now completes successfully with warnings but no errors
- All components maintain their original functionality
- No breaking changes to the application behavior

## Scripts
