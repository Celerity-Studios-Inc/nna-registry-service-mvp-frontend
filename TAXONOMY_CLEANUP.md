# Taxonomy Component Cleanup

## Overview
This document describes the cleanup and improvements made to the SimpleTaxonomySelectionV3 component to enhance performance, readability, and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Layer Grid from Step 2
- Removed the redundant Layer Grid from Step 2 since the layer is already selected in Step 1
- Streamlined the UI to focus on Category and Subcategory selection
- Updated the component to start directly with Category selection (Step 2)

### 2. Fixed Card Label Formatting
- Added text truncation for long category and subcategory names
- Implemented ellipsis and proper line clamping:
  ```css
  height: '40px', 
  overflow: 'hidden',
  textOverflow: 'ellipsis',
  display: '-webkit-box',
  WebkitLineClamp: 2,
  WebkitBoxOrient: 'vertical'
  ```
- Added `noWrap` property to code labels to prevent wrapping
- Improved readability by replacing underscores with spaces in display names

### 3. Reduced Console Logging
- Removed excessive console.log statements
- Preserved important logger calls for error handling and debugging
- Centralized logging through the logger utility instead of direct console calls

### 4. Made Debug Mode Development-Only
- Added conditional rendering to show debug mode toggle only in development environments:
  ```jsx
  {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
    <Button 
      size="small" 
      variant="outlined" 
      onClick={toggleDebugMode}
    >
      {debugMode ? 'Hide Debug Info' : 'Show Debug Info'}
    </Button>
  )}
  ```
- Debug information panel is now only visible when:
  - The application is running in development mode AND
  - Debug mode is explicitly enabled via the toggle button

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper cleanup on component unmount
- Added isMounted reference to prevent state updates after unmounting
- Enhanced error handling in asynchronous operations

### 6. Code Organization
- Added clear section comments
- Organized imports for better readability
- Improved function declarations and naming conventions

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized console output for production environments
- Better memory management with proper cleanup

### UI Improvements
- Cleaner interface without redundant layer selection
- Better text formatting with proper overflow handling
- Consistent card sizing and appearance
- More intuitive information hierarchy

### Developer Experience
- Clearer code organization
- Better debugging tools in development mode
- Improved error handling for easier troubleshooting

## Future Considerations
- Consider further performance optimizations with React.memo
- Add more targeted error recovery mechanisms
- Enhance accessibility for screen readers
