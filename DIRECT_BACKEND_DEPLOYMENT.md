# Very Simple Backend Deployment Instructions

I've created an even simpler script that should work better. This approach uses a very basic Dockerfile that should work with your backend code.

## What Went Wrong Previously

The build failed because the Dockerfile or code structure might have been too complex for the automatic build process. This new approach uses a much simpler Dockerfile that should be more compatible.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Click the Spotlight (magnifying glass) in the top-right of your screen
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate to the Frontend Project

1. In the Terminal, type this command exactly as shown and press Enter:
   ```
   cd /Users/ajaymadhok/nna-registry-workspace/nna-registry-service-mvp-frontend
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Simple Deployment Script

1. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```
   ./simple-backend-deploy.sh
   ```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - A browser window may open for Google Cloud login (if not already logged in)
   - Log in with your Google account
   - Return to the terminal window
   - The script will create a simpler Dockerfile and deploy your backend

3. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

### Step 4: Check the Deployment Status

Your service should be accessible at:
```
https://nna-registry-service-us-central1.a.run.app
```

## What This Script Does Differently

1. Creates a much simpler Dockerfile
2. Uses the basic Node.js runtime (not Alpine)
3. Includes all dependencies, not just production ones
4. Directly runs the main.js file
5. Sets a longer timeout for the deployment

## If You Still Have Issues

If this approach still doesn't work, we may need to:
1. Check if there are specific requirements for your backend code
2. Look at the main.js file to ensure it's properly structured
3. Consider using a pre-built Docker image
