# Build Trigger for Asset Detail View Fix

This file is created to trigger a new build for deploying the asset detail view fix to Vercel.

## Changes Summary
- Fixed 404 errors when viewing asset details
- Implemented proper handling of MongoDB ID formats
- Updated the API proxy to properly route MongoDB ID requests
- Enhanced the Asset service with better error handling and fallbacks

## Fixed Components
- `api/asset-proxy.ts`: Rewrites MongoDB ID paths to the format expected by the backend
- `src/api/assetService.ts`: Enhanced to handle both regular and MongoDB ID formats
- `src/components/asset/AssetCard.tsx`: Better ID format detection during navigation

## Testing Instructions
1. Once deployed, navigate to the assets search page
2. Search for some assets (e.g., "Coachella")
3. Click "View Details" on any asset card
4. Verify that the asset detail page loads successfully, without 404 errors
