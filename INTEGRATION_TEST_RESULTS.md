# Three-Environment Strategy Integration Test Results

**Test Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Test Status:** ✅ Backend Ready, ⚠️ Frontend Development Environment Pending

## 🎯 **Backend Environment Status**

### ✅ **All Backend Environments: HEALTHY**

| Environment | Backend URL | Status | Version | Response Time |
|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Development** | `https://registry.dev.reviz.dev` | ✅ Healthy | 1.0.1 | ~350ms |
| **Staging** | `https://registry.stg.reviz.dev` | ✅ Healthy | 1.0.1 | ~630ms |
| **Production** | `https://registry.reviz.dev` | ✅ Healthy | 1.0.1 | ~260ms |

**✅ CORS Confirmation**: Backend team confirmed CORS is configured for all frontend domains

## 🌐 **Frontend Environment Status**

### ✅ **Working Environments**

| Environment | Frontend URL | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| **Production** | `https://nna-registry-frontend.vercel.app` | ✅ Active | HTTP 200, React App loading |
| **Staging** | `https://nna-registry-frontend-stg.vercel.app` | ✅ Active | HTTP 200, CORS headers present |

### ⚠️ **Pending Setup**

| Environment | Frontend URL | Status | Action Needed |
|-------------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| **Development** | `https://nna-registry-dev-frontend.vercel.app` | ❌ 404 | Create development environment in Vercel |

## 📋 **Integration Testing Progress**

### ✅ **Completed Tests**
- [x] Backend health checks (all three environments)
- [x] Frontend production environment verification  
- [x] Frontend staging environment verification
- [x] CORS configuration confirmation from backend team
- [x] Environment detection logic implementation

### ⏳ **Pending Tests** 
- [ ] Create development environment in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Test environment banner display (red/orange/green colors)
- [ ] Asset registration across all three environments
- [ ] Data isolation verification (no cross-environment data leakage)
- [ ] Video thumbnail generation testing
- [ ] Complete user workflow testing

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Create Development Environment in Vercel**
   - Configure `nna-registry-dev-frontend.vercel.app` domain
   - Deploy latest commits to development environment
   - Verify environment detection and red banner display

2. **Manual Testing Phase**
   - Visit all three frontend URLs
   - Verify environment banner colors match (red/orange/green)
   - Test asset registration workflow in each environment
   - Confirm data isolation between environments

### **Testing Checklist from Frontend Checklist**

#### **A. Environment Files** ✅
- [x] Correct API base URLs configured for each environment
- [x] Environment detection implemented
- [x] Smart routing configured

#### **B. CORS and Asset Previews** ✅ (Backend Confirmed)
- [x] Backend CORS configured for all frontend domains
- [x] Asset routing points to correct environment backends
- [x] `crossOrigin="anonymous"` implemented in media elements

#### **C. Data Isolation** ⏳ (Pending Testing)
