# UI Formatting Fixes

This document summarizes the UI formatting improvements implemented to address display issues in the NNA Registry Service frontend.

## Issues Fixed

1. **File Type Text Overflow in Upload Component**
   - Text displaying allowed file types was overflowing its container
   - Long list of MIME types made the interface confusing
   
2. **Inconsistent Display of Category/Subcategory Codes**
   - Category was showing with numeric code: "Contemporary_Dance (011)"
   - Subcategory was showing with alphabetic code: "Lyrical (LYR)"
   - Inconsistent display across different screens

## Implementation Details

### File Upload Component Improvements

1. **Enhanced File Type Display**
   - Reorganized file types into logical groups (Images, Audio, Video, 3D, etc.)
   - Implemented a chip-based UI for compact display
   - Added visual separation between file type groups
   - Moved file type information outside the dashed border container

2. **File Size Validation**
   - Added clear client-side validation for the 100 MB file size limit
   - Improved error messages showing size in human-readable format
   - Prevents 413 errors by validating before upload attempt

### Taxonomy Code Consistency

1. **Enhanced Taxonomy Mapper**
   - Added a universal `getAlphabeticCode` function to the taxonomyMapper service
   - Provides consistent code display across all components
   - Maintains special case handling for important codes (HIP, POP, HPM)

2. **Updated Display Components**
   - Modified ReviewSubmit component to display both category and subcategory with alphabetic codes
   - Updated TaxonomySelection component to use consistent code display
   - Ensured proper code display in the NNA Address preview

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/common/FileUploader.tsx`
   - Redesigned file type display with chips
   - Improved styling and layout

2. `src/components/asset/FileUpload.tsx`
   - Added file size validation
   - Improved error messaging
   - Fixed layout issues

3. `src/api/taxonomyMapper.ts`
   - Added a new `getAlphabeticCode` function
   - Enhanced code conversion logic

4. `src/components/asset/ReviewSubmit.tsx`
   - Updated to use consistent alphabetic codes for both category and subcategory

5. `src/components/asset/TaxonomySelection.tsx`
   - Updated to use taxonomyMapper for consistent code display

## Testing

The fixes have been verified for:

1. **File Upload Component**
   - Various file types display correctly without overflow
   - File size validation prevents uploads exceeding 100 MB
   - Error messages are clear and helpful

2. **Taxonomy Display**
   - Category and subcategory codes display consistently
   - All codes show in alphabetic format (e.g., "POP", "DCL", "HIP")
   - Special cases like S.POP.HPM display correctly

## Impact

These improvements enhance the user experience by:

1. Making the interface more visually consistent
2. Improving error handling and validation
3. Reducing confusion around code formats
4. Preventing potential API errors from oversized files
5. Making the UI more compact and readable
