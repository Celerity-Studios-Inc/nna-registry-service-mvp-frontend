# Taxonomy Issue Analysis for Claude

## Problem Overview

The NNA Registry Service Frontend is experiencing issues with its taxonomy system, particularly around the mapping between human-friendly names (HFN) and machine-friendly addresses (MFA). The specific case that highlighted this issue was the `W.BCH.SUN` mapping, which was incorrectly using a hash-based fallback mechanism rather than the proper code `003`.

## Chronology of Changes and Issues

### Initial Stable State

The application initially had a working taxonomy system with:
1. Complete taxonomy data in `src/assets/enriched_nna_layer_taxonomy_v1.3.json`
2. Basic taxonomy mapping in `src/api/taxonomyService.ts`
3. Correct display of category and subcategory names in the UI

### Recent Changes Timeline

#### 1. Fix attempt for W.BCH.SUN issue (Commit 0fdf70a)

**Changes made:**
- Enhanced `taxonomyService.ts` with resilient fallback mechanisms 
- Added extensive try-catch blocks
- Implemented case-insensitive and partial name matching
- Added special case handling for S.POP.HPM
- Included hash-based fallback for unknown subcategories

**Key issues:**
- While this added robustness for some cases, it made the code complex
- The hash-based fallback mechanism remained, which was error-prone
- Special case handling was still scattered across the code

#### 2. "Data-driven" approach (Commit 94adbf6)

**Changes made:**
- Completely replaced the comprehensive taxonomy JSON with a minimal version
- Created a separate `taxonomyMapper.ts` file
- Enhanced `codeMapping.ts` with explicit mappings
- Added extensive special case handling

**Critical issue:**
- The taxonomy JSON was reduced from 2,250+ lines to just 278 lines
- Most taxonomy data was lost, leaving only a small subset of categories
- This commit attempted to move from data-driven to code-driven approach but broke the UI

#### 3. Attempted rollbacks and fixes

We have tried several rollbacks to find a working version:
- Rolling back to a8c9d7d (before taxonomy implementation)
- Rolling back to 6c2262c (targeted W.BCH.SUN fix)
- Rolling back to d5ebcb9 (before any W.BCH.SUN work)

None of these rollbacks have fully restored the application to a working state with correctly displayed taxonomy data.

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issues appear to be:

1. **Data vs. Code Approach Conflict**:
   - The original system used a comprehensive taxonomy JSON file
   - Recent changes tried to replace this with hardcoded mappings
   - The incomplete transition left the system in an inconsistent state

2. **Taxonomy JSON Truncation**:
   - The comprehensive taxonomy JSON was replaced with a minimal version
   - This lost most category and subcategory data
   - UI components expected complete data but received partial data

3. **Special Case Handling Complexity**:
   - Special cases like W.BCH.SUN were handled through increasingly complex code
   - This led to a maze of conditional logic and fallbacks
   - The system became brittle and hard to maintain

4. **Hash-based Fallback Mechanism**:
   - The use of hash-based coding for unknown subcategories
   - This created unpredictable results when subcategories weren't found

## Current State

The UI is displaying incorrect category and subcategory labels:
- Some are showing numeric codes instead of names (e.g., "Dance_Electronic" as "004")
- Some categories are completely missing
- Wrong categories are showing up under certain layers

## Recommended Fix Approach

1. **Restore Complete Taxonomy Data**:
   - Revert to the full `enriched_nna_layer_taxonomy_v1.3.json` file
   - Ensure all layers, categories, and subcategories are included

2. **Implement Targeted Fix for W.BCH.SUN**:
   - Add a simple, specific mapping for W.BCH.SUN â†’ 003
   - Use a minimal approach that doesn't disrupt the rest of the system

3. **Remove Hash-based Fallback**:
   - Replace hash-based fallbacks with safe defaults
   - Provide meaningful error messages for missing mappings

4. **Simplify Special Case Handling**:
   - Use a small set of explicit mappings for known special cases
   - Keep the code readable and maintainable

5. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Create specific tests for W.BCH.SUN and other edge cases
   - Verify taxonomy display across all layers and categories
   - Ensure both the visual display and the underlying code mappings work correctly

This analysis should help Claude understand the complex issues with the taxonomy system and provide guidance for a clean, focused fix.
