# Asset Registration Error Handling Improvements

## Summary

This document describes improvements made to the error handling in the Asset Registration flow, specifically focused on the `AssetRegistrationWrapper` component.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced `AssetRegistrationWrapper` Component

The component has been updated with the following improvements:

1. **More Robust State Management**
   - Added `hasError` and `errorDetails` states to track error conditions
   - Maintains separate loading and error states for better UI control

2. **Systematic Taxonomy Verification**
   - Created `verifyLayerCategories` to check for available taxonomy categories
   - Implemented `verifySpecialCaseMappings` to validate critical HFN-to-MFA mappings
   - Added comprehensive error detection for taxonomy integrity

3. **Detailed Error Reporting**
   - Now captures and displays technical error details
   - Provides context-specific error messages based on verification results
   - Uses the `logger` utility for consistent error logging

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Added a dedicated "Retry Loading" button
   - Improved error boundary UI with better recovery options
   - Preserves detailed error context for debugging

5. **Better User Feedback**
   - Uses `FeedbackContext` for toast notifications
   - Shows appropriate warnings when partial failures occur
   - Provides clear success messages when verification completes

6. **Integration with useTaxonomy Hook**
   - Leverages the new `useTaxonomy` hook for consistent taxonomy handling
   - Ensures taxonomy verification is thorough and standards-based

## Error Handling Strategy

The enhanced component follows this error handling strategy:

1. **Attempt verification** of the taxonomy service
2. **Detect both critical and non-critical** issues
3. **Continue with warnings** for non-critical issues
4. **Block rendering with recovery options** for critical failures
5. **Log detailed information** to assist developers

## Technical Implementation

- Uses callback-based verification functions for better organization
- Implements Promise.all for parallel verification tasks
- Properly isolates error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
- Provides consistent logging for errors, warnings, and successes

## User Experience

The improved error handling provides:

1. Clear loading indicators during verification
2. Informative error messages when issues occur
3. Easy-to-use recovery options
4. Technical details for support and debugging
5. Warning indicators for potential issues that don't block usage

## Next Steps

Further improvements could include:

1. Adding unit tests for the verification functions
2. Implementing a more comprehensive taxonomy validation suite
3. Adding telemetry for tracking error frequency and patterns
4. Creating a dedicated taxonomy service status dashboard
