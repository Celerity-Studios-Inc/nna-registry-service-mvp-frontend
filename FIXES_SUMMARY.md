# NNA Registry Service Frontend Fixes Summary

## Previous Fixes (Asset Creation)

1. **Mock Mode Detection**
   - Added `apiConfig.useMockApi` flag in api.ts
   - Added localStorage override with 'forceMockApi' key
   - Fixed asset creation to respect these settings
   - Added force real mode check with explicit localStorage verification

2. **Field Naming Issues**
   - Fixed `categoryCode` → `category` in API requests
   - Fixed `subcategoryCode` → `subcategory` in API requests
   - Ensured `source` field has default 'ReViz' value
   - Ensured `components` field uses proper format (`JSON.stringify([])`)

3. **Logo Image Fix**
   - Replaced empty logo files with proper images
   - Updated manifest.json app name to better reflect the application

## New Fixes (Taxonomy, Navigation, and Error Handling)

### 1. Taxonomy Mapping and NNA Address Generation

- **Fixed subcategory code mapping**: Corrected the mapping for `W.CST.FES` (Festival) to ensure the MFA code is correctly displayed as `5.002.003.000` instead of the incorrect `5.002.093.000`.
- **Added robust fallback handling**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing taxonomy entries to ensure the application doesn't break when encountering unknown codes.
- **Implemented human-readable name formatting**: Added a utility function to display user-friendly names for taxonomy codes.
- **Special case handling**: Added explicit handling for problematic combinations like `W.CST.FES` and `S.POP.HPM`.

### 2. API Error Handling and Mock Data Removal

- **Removed mock data fallbacks**: Eliminated placeholder data generation when API calls fail to prevent confusion between real and generated assets.
- **Added structured error responses**: Implemented detailed error information with user-friendly messages to help users understand connection issues.
- **Normalized API responses**: Created consistent handling of different API response formats to improve reliability.

### 3. Navigation Improvements

- **Fixed asset card navigation**: Added proper `onClick` handling to enable direct navigation to asset details by clicking anywhere on the card.
- **Implemented React Router navigation**: Used the `useNavigate` hook for consistent programmatic navigation.
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added proper error handling for missing asset IDs to prevent navigation to invalid URLs.

### 4. UI Enhancements

- **Improved source field rendering**: Fixed the source field in RegisterAssetPage to provide consistent UI and validation.
- **Better loading and error states**: Added clear loading and error states for improved user experience.

## Test Sequence

### 1. Asset Registration

1. Navigate to "Register Asset"
2. Select "World" layer
3. Choose "Concert_Stages" category and "Festival" subcategory
4. Verify the NNA address preview shows the correct MFA: `5.002.003.000`
5. Upload a file, enter name, description, and source
6. Submit and verify successful creation

### 2. Browse Assets

1. Navigate to "Browse Assets"
2. Verify error handling if backend returns 500 error (clear message, no fake data)
3. Test search functionality with real data once backend is working
4. Verify clicking directly on asset cards navigates to asset details
5. Verify "View Details" button also navigates correctly

### 3. Asset Details

1. Navigate to an asset's details page
2. Verify the correct display of asset information
3. Test navigation back to the asset list

## Current Status

All identified issues have been fixed in the codebase. Key improvements:

1. **Taxonomy Handling**: Special case handling is in place for all known problematic combinations.
2. **Navigation**: All click targets now properly navigate to the correct details page.
3. **Error Handling**: Removed all mock data generation in favor of proper error messages.
4. **UI Consistency**: Fixed source field and form validation.

## Verification

To verify the fixes, you can:

1. Test the Asset Registration workflow:
   - Verify that the MFA code for W.CST.FES displays correctly as `5.002.003.000`
   - Check that source field renders and validates properly

2. Test the Browse Assets workflow:
   - Verify that error messages display when backend fails
   - Confirm that clicking on asset cards navigates correctly
   - Ensure "View Details" button works

## Technical Implementation Details

1. Added special case handling in `taxonomyService.ts` for `W.CST.FES`
2. Implemented fallback subcategory creation for unknown taxonomy entries
3. Improved error handling in `assetService.ts` to return structured error objects
4. Added proper React Router navigation in `AssetCard.tsx`
5. Fixed source field rendering in `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`
