## Previous Build - May 14, 2025 (1) - Asset Browsing Improvements

### Asset Browsing Improvements

- Changed "Search Results" to "Recent Assets" when no search is performed

### Search Functionality Fix (Previous)

- Fixed a critical issue with the search functionality that was preventing search results from displaying
- The root cause was a mismatch between the frontend's expected API response format and the actual backend response format
- Modified components to handle both response formats for backward compatibility:

  - Updated `SearchAssetsPage.tsx` for consistent response handling
  - Enhanced `assetService.ts` to normalize API responses

### Expected Improvements

- File previews now work correctly throughout the entire asset lifecycle
- Video and audio files display properly in all steps, including when editing existing assets
- Search results display properly with correct filtering and pagination
- Type safety improvements reduce the likelihood of future errors

### Testing Performed

- Tested file uploads with various file types (images, videos, audio)
- Verified proper preview rendering in both the upload and review steps
- Confirmed search functionality works correctly with various filter combinations
