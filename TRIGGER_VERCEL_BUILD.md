## Latest Build - May 14, 2025 - Continued Improvements

### File Preview Fixes

- Fixed issues with file previews across the application
- Improved handling of video and audio files in the asset creation workflow
- Ensured previews work consistently between the upload, edit, and review steps
- Enhanced the FilePreview component to handle various file formats and sources
- Fixed metadata extraction for more consistent file information display

### Search Functionality Fix (Previous)

- Fixed a critical issue with the search functionality that was preventing search results from displaying
- The root cause was a mismatch between the frontend's expected API response format and the actual backend response format
- Modified components to handle both response formats for backward compatibility:
  - Updated `AssetSearch.tsx` to correctly parse search results
  - Updated `SearchAssetsPage.tsx` for consistent response handling
  - Enhanced `assetService.ts` to normalize API responses

### Expected Improvements

- File previews now work correctly throughout the entire asset lifecycle
- Video and audio files display properly in all steps, including when editing existing assets
- Search results display properly with correct filtering and pagination
- Type safety improvements reduce the likelihood of future errors

### Testing Performed

- Tested file uploads with various file types (images, videos, audio)
- Verified proper preview rendering in both the upload and review steps
- Confirmed search functionality works correctly with various filter combinations
