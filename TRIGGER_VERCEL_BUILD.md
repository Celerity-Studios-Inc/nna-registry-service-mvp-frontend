### Search Functionality Fix

- Fixed a critical issue with the search functionality that was preventing search results from displaying
- The root cause was a mismatch between the frontend's expected API response format and the actual backend response format
- Modified components to handle both response formats for backward compatibility:
  - Updated `AssetSearch.tsx` to correctly parse search results
  - Updated `SearchAssetsPage.tsx` for consistent response handling
  - Enhanced `assetService.ts` to normalize API responses

### Expected Improvements

- Users can now search for assets using the search bar and filter options
- Search results will properly display in the UI
- Pagination data will be correctly interpreted from the API response

### Testing Performed

- Verified that the search interface can send queries to the backend API
- Confirmed that results are properly displayed when returned from the backend
- Tested with both old and new API response formats to ensure backward compatibility
