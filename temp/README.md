# Temporary Resources Directory

This directory contains temporary resources and backups for the NNA Registry Service MVP Frontend project.

## Directory Structure

- `/temp/clones/` - Repository clones for reference and development
- `/temp/backups/` - Backups of important files and directories

## Purpose

This directory is used to store resources that are not directly part of the application but are useful for development, testing, and reference. These include:

1. Repository clones of different versions of the codebase
2. Backups of important files before major changes
3. Temporary test data and configuration files

## Guidelines

When working with files in this directory:

1. Do not rely on these files for application functionality
2. Use clear naming conventions for temporary directories
3. Clean up obsolete temporary files regularly
4. Document the purpose of clones and backups in a README.md within each directory
5. Be mindful of version control - avoid unnecessarily large commits with temporary files
