# Asset Creation Findings

## Current Status

After extensive testing, we've discovered several critical requirements for successfully creating assets with the backend API:

1. **Components Format**: The backend requires the components field to be sent in array bracket format as `components[]` rather than a JSON-stringified array.

2. **Taxonomy Requirements**: The backend has its own taxonomy validation rules that don't always match what's in our local taxonomy files. We've systematically tested multiple subcategory options for the S/POP combination and they're all rejected.

3. **Source Field**: The source field is correctly implemented in both the API and the UI form (it appears in RegisterAssetPage.tsx between Description and Tags).

4. **Mock Implementation**: The UI is currently using the mock implementation for asset creation because `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API = true` in the environment.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Components Format**: We've updated the codebase to use `components[]` format rather than `JSON.stringify([])`. This should fix the "components must be an array" error.

2. **Fix Taxonomy Mismatch**: We need to clarify exactly what subcategory values are valid for each layer/category combination in the real backend. Some options are:
   - Request access to the backend's taxonomy file
   - Work with backend team to ensure our taxonomy matches
   - Add backend logging to capture the exact taxonomy requirements

3. **Switch to Real API**: To test with the real backend API:
   - Set `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API = false` in the .env file
   - Make sure the authentication token is valid 
   - Deploy the updated version to test asset creation

4. **Verify Logo Fix**: The logo image files have been updated, but we need to verify they're working correctly in the deployed version.

## Summary of Changes

We've made the following key changes to the codebase:

1. **Field Format Fixes**:
   - Changed components format from `JSON.stringify([])` to `components[]`
   - Updated types and documentation to reflect the correct formats

2. **Testing**:
   - Created a comprehensive taxonomy test script that tries different subcategory options
   - Updated test-final-solution.mjs to use the correct components format

3. **Logo Fixes**:
   - Replaced empty logo files with valid images
   - Updated manifest.json app name

The UI form already has the source field implemented, so no changes were needed there.

## Testing Results

Our latest test script shows two main issues:

1. Authentication: We need to ensure we have a valid token for connecting to the real backend.
2. Taxonomy validation: The backend rejects all subcategory combinations we've tried for S/POP.
