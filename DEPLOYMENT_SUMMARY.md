# NNA Registry Service Frontend Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to solve the CORS issues and implement automated CI/CD deployment for the NNA Registry Service Frontend. It provides a comprehensive overview of changes made, deployment process, and documentation created.

## Problems Addressed

1. **CORS Issues**: 
   - Frontend deployed to Vercel couldn't access the backend API due to CORS restrictions
   - API requests to registry.reviz.dev were blocked by browser security
   
2. **CI/CD Automation**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow setup was needed for automated deployments
   - Vercel project required proper configuration for React application

## Solution Implemented

### CORS Solution

A three-part approach was implemented to solve CORS issues:

1. **Client-side API Configuration**:
   - Modified API client in `src/api/api.ts` to use relative URL paths (`/api`)
   - Updated `.env.production` with correct API URL setting

2. **Vercel Configuration**:
   - Updated `vercel.json` with proper rewrites to proxy API requests
   - Configured framework settings for Create React App

3. **API Proxy**:
   - Implemented a serverless function in `api/proxy.js`
   - The proxy adds CORS headers and forwards requests to the backend

### CI/CD Implementation

GitHub Actions workflow setup to automate deployments:

1. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - Created `.github/workflows/main-deploy.yml`
   - Configured trigger on push to main branch
   - Set up build and deployment steps

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Added steps to create proper environment file
   - Configured correct environment variables

3. **Vercel Integration**:
   - Used Vercel GitHub Action for deployment
   - Added proper authentication with Vercel tokens

## Files Modified/Created

### Key Modified Files:

1. `src/api/api.ts`: 
   - Updated API client to use relative URL
   - Added proper error handling

2. `.env.production`:
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_URL=/api`
   - Set `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=false`

3. `vercel.json`:
   - Added proper rewrites for API proxy
   - Configured framework settings for React

4. `.github/workflows/main-deploy.yml`:
   - Created workflow for automated deployments
   - Fixed branch reference

### New Files:

1. `api/proxy.js`:
   - Implemented serverless function for API proxy
   - Added CORS header handling

2. Documentation:
   - `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`
   - `VERCEL_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
   - `CORS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - `VERCEL_LOGS.md`
   - `README_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md`
   - `PR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Deployment Process

The deployment process now follows these steps:

1. **Code Changes**:
   - Developers make changes and push to feature branches
   - Pull requests are created to merge into main

2. **Automated Deployment**:
   - When PR is merged to main, GitHub Actions workflow triggers
   - The workflow builds the application
   - Vercel deployment is initiated with proper settings
   - Application is deployed to production

3. **Verification**:
   - Deployment logs are checked for errors
   - Application is tested for CORS issues
   - Basic functionality verification

## Documentation Created

Multiple documentation files were created to assist with deployment and troubleshooting:

1. **PR Instructions** (`PR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`):
   - How to create the PR to merge changes
   - What to include in the PR description

2. **Deployment Verification** (`DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`):
   - Steps to verify successful deployment
   - Tests to ensure the application works correctly
   - Common issues and solutions

3. **Vercel Secrets Setup** (`VERCEL_SECRETS_SETUP.md`):
   - How to create and set up required Vercel tokens
   - Where to find organization and project IDs
   - How to add secrets to GitHub repository

4. **CORS Troubleshooting** (`CORS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`):
   - Common CORS issues and solutions
   - Debugging steps
   - Advanced troubleshooting techniques

5. **Vercel Logs** (`VERCEL_LOGS.md`):
   - How to access and monitor Vercel logs
   - Understanding log messages
   - Setting up alerts and integrations

6. **README Update** (`README_DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md`):
   - Updated deployment section for main README
   - Instructions for various deployment options
   - Environment variable information

## Next Steps

1. **Create PR to Merge**:
   - Follow the instructions in `PR_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Merge the feature branch to main

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Check Vercel logs for any issues
   - Verify the deployment succeeds

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - After successful deployment, merge the README update
   - Remove any documentation files that are no longer needed
   - Update docs based on actual deployment experience

4. **Future Improvements**:
   - Consider setting up preview deployments for PRs
   - Add more comprehensive testing in the workflow
   - Implement staging environment for pre-production testing

## Conclusion

The CORS issues have been resolved by implementing a proper API proxy approach, and automated CI/CD has been set up with GitHub Actions. The solution is robust, maintainable, and includes comprehensive documentation for future reference.
