# Taxonomy Service Fix

## Problem
The enhanced taxonomy service was incorrectly using hardcoded fallback data from `taxonomyFallbackData.ts` as the primary source of taxonomy information, instead of using the flattened taxonomy data from the `/flattened_taxonomy` folder. This resulted in incorrect subcategory names being displayed in the UI, such as:

- "Diva" instead of "Pop_Diva_Female_Stars"
- "Indie Female" instead of "Pop_Idol_Female_Stars" 
- "LGBTQ+ Female" instead of "Pop_Legend_Female_Stars"

This was particularly problematic for certain layer/category combinations like S.POP and W.BCH.

## Root Cause
The `enhancedTaxonomyService.ts` file was importing both the original JSON taxonomy data and the flattened taxonomy data, but was prioritizing hardcoded fallbacks in `taxonomyFallbackData.ts` over the actual flattened taxonomy data in its logic.

The JSON file approach had previously been abandoned due to token limitations (25,000 token limit), which is why we had already created the flattened taxonomy structure. However, the service was still trying to reference the JSON file first, and falling back to hardcoded data when it couldn't find the information.

## Solution
1. Updated `enhancedTaxonomyService.ts` to remove references to the JSON file and prioritize the flattened taxonomy data:
   - Removed import of `taxonomyDataImport` from JSON
   - Prioritized LAYER_LOOKUPS and LAYER_SUBCATEGORIES from flattened taxonomy

2. Rewrote the `getSubcategories` function with the following priority order:
   - First, try to get subcategories from the flattened taxonomy (LAYER_SUBCATEGORIES)
   - Second, derive subcategories from the lookup entries (LAYER_LOOKUPS)
   - Third, handle special cases (S.POP, W.BCH) with corrected names from flattened taxonomy
   - Finally, use hardcoded fallbacks only as a last resort

3. Updated utility functions to work with the flattened taxonomy:
   - Updated `inspectTaxonomyStructure` to use LAYER_LOOKUPS instead of the JSON file
   - Enhanced `debugTaxonomyData` to provide more detailed information about subcategory names

## Expected Impact
- Subcategory names will now be correctly displayed in the UI, such as "Pop_Diva_Female_Stars" instead of "Diva"
- The taxonomy service will be more reliable and consistent since it's using the flattened taxonomy as the source of truth
- The code is more maintainable and avoids token limit issues with large JSON files
- Enhanced debugging tools will make it easier to identify and fix any remaining taxonomy issues

## Testing
The fix can be verified by:
1. Checking the subcategory names for S.POP in the UI to ensure they display correctly
2. Verifying W.BCH subcategories display the correct names
3. Testing special cases like S.POP.HPM to ensure they still work correctly for HFN to MFA conversion
