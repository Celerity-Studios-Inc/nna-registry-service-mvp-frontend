# NNA Registry Service Taxonomy Fix Solution

## Overview

This branch contains a focused solution to fix the taxonomy mapping issue while maintaining the working UI. By only updating the critical taxonomy mapping files and not modifying UI components, we've preserved the functional UI while ensuring proper mapping of critical cases like `W.BCH.SUN.001` → `5.004.003.001` and `S.POP.HPM.001` → `2.001.007.001`.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Flattened Taxonomy Files**:
   - `src/taxonomyLookup/S_layer.ts`: Added Star layer taxonomy mappings 
   - `src/taxonomyLookup/constants.ts`: Added constants to centralize taxonomy lookups
   - Updated `src/taxonomyLookup/index.ts` to export both layers

2. **Updated Taxonomy Service**:
   - Modified `src/services/simpleTaxonomyService.ts` to use both S and W layers
   - Ensured critical mappings work properly for both layers

3. **Added Test Tool**:
   - `public/test-taxonomy-mapping.html`: Visual test tool to verify critical mappings

## What's Not Changed

- No UI components were modified
- No changes to the SimpleTaxonomySelection component
- No changes to LayerSelector
- No changes to React hooks

## Verification Steps

1. **Build the Application**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test Critical Mappings**:
   - Open `/test-taxonomy-mapping.html` in a browser from the build directory
   - Verify that both test cases pass:
     - W.BCH.SUN.001 → 5.004.003.001
     - S.POP.HPM.001 → 2.001.007.001

3. **Verify UI Works**:
   - The UI should function correctly with properly displayed layers, categories, and subcategories
   - Double-clicking on layer cards should work
   - No green checkboxes should appear in the UI

## Technical Implementation

The solution focuses on taxonomy data structures rather than UI components:

1. We added proper layer mapping tables for S_layer and W_layer
2. We imported them correctly in the taxonomy service
3. We kept the UI code untouched, letting it use the fixed taxonomy data

This isolated approach ensures that the UI remains functional while fixing the critical taxonomy mapping issues that caused the deployment error.
