- [ ] **Type Safety**: Add stricter TypeScript types where beneficial
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking for key operations

## ðŸ“Š **Testing Framework**

### **Test Categories**
1. **Functional Testing**: All features work as designed
2. **Performance Testing**: Response times and resource usage
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Unusual inputs and error scenarios  
4. **Integration Testing**: Frontend-backend communication
5. **User Experience Testing**: Workflow smoothness and usability

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… **Asset Creation**: 100% success rate across all layers
- âœ… **Performance**: AI processing under 30 seconds for most cases
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- âœ… **TypeScript**: Clean compilation with no warnings
- âœ… **User Experience**: Smooth, professional workflows

## ðŸ”— **Reference Documents for Testing**

### **Technical References**
- `SESSION_HANDOVER_CONTEXT.md` - Complete context of current state
- `docs/SESSION_RECOVERY_LOG.md` - Detailed technical recovery information
- `CLAUDE.md` - Current system status and features
- `/src/api/assetService.ts` - FormData handling and debugging
- `/src/services/openaiService.ts` - Enhanced BPM detection

### **Test Credentials**
- **Email**: `ajay@testuser.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Environment**: Development (`https://nna-registry-frontend-dev.vercel.app`)
- **Backend**: Development (`https://registry.dev.reviz.dev`)

### **Known Working Test Case**
**Sabrina Carpenter "Manchild"** (verified working):
- Layer: G (Songs)
- Creator's Description: `Song = "Manchild", Artist = "Sabrina Carpenter", Album = "Man's Best Friend"`
- Expected BPM: 110bpm tag
- Expected Album Art: iTunes integration working

## ðŸŽ¯ **Session Flow Recommendation**

### **Phase 1: Quick Validation** (30 minutes)
1. Run the verified Sabrina Carpenter test to confirm system still working
2. Create one asset in each layer (G, S, L, M, W, C) for basic validation
3. Check console logs for any new errors or issues

### **Phase 2: Systematic Testing** (60 minutes)
1. Methodically test each layer with various asset types
2. Document any issues, performance concerns, or optimization opportunities
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios

### **Phase 3: Optimization Implementation** (Remaining time)
1. Implement highest-priority optimizations identified
2. Enhance user experience based on testing findings
3. Update documentation with testing results

## ðŸš¨ **Potential Issues to Watch**

### **Known Areas of Concern**
- **Large File Uploads**: Monitor timeout behavior and FormData transmission
- **AI Processing Times**: Some layers may take longer than others
- **Browser Memory**: Video processing might consume significant memory
- **Network Dependencies**: iTunes API and OpenAI API reliability

### **Debugging Resources**
- FormData debugging logs in browser console
- Response header logging for API communication
- BPM detection logging for tempo analysis
- Environment detection logs for configuration verification
