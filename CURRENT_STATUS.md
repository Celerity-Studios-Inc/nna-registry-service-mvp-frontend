# Current Project Status - May 18, 2025

## Recently Completed Work

1. **Subcategory Loading Fix**: 
   - Implemented direct taxonomyService calls in SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2.tsx
   - Added multiple fallback mechanisms for subcategory loading
   - Enhanced error handling and retry functionality
   - Added diagnostic logging to track subcategory loading status
   - Document: [SUBCATEGORY_LOADING_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SUBCATEGORY_LOADING_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
   - Commit: 41125d1 - "Fix subcategory loading with direct service call approach"
   - Build: CI/CD #262

2. **Previous Taxonomy Fixes**:
   - Fixed taxonomy mapping compatibility issues, particularly for S.POP.HPM
   - Enhanced lookup logic for S layer subcategories
   - Document: [SUBCATEGORY_DISPLAY_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SUBCATEGORY_DISPLAY_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

## Current Status

The application is currently building and deploying via GitHub CI/CD pipeline (build #262). Key changes include:

- Direct subcategory loading implementation to bypass context system issues
- Multiple fallback strategies to ensure subcategories always load
- Enhanced debugging tools embedded in the UI
- Improved error recovery mechanisms

## Next Priorities

1. **Double-Click Navigation Fix**:
   - Issue: Double-clicking a layer card in RegisterAssetPage doesn't advance to Step 2
   - Files to examine: 
     - src/pages/RegisterAssetPage.tsx
     - src/components/asset/LayerSelector.tsx or LayerSelectorV2.tsx
   - Potential approach: Implement or fix double-click event handler

2. **Clean Up Excessive Logging**:
   - Remove or conditionally render diagnostic information
   - Make logging more targeted and only in development environment
   - Simplify debug panels for production use

3. **UX Improvements**:
   - Improve loading feedback during subcategory loading
   - Enhance navigation between registration steps
   - Add visual confirmation of successful selections

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified

- `src/components/asset/SimpleTaxonomySelectionV2.tsx`: Main component with subcategory loading fix
- `src/services/simpleTaxonomyService.ts`: Core taxonomy service, enhanced for reliable subcategory retrieval

### Debug Notes

- Console logs have been added to track subcategory loading steps
- Watch for "Directly loaded subcategories" logs to confirm direct approach is working
- Check for "Using direct subcategories as fallback" logs when context approach fails

### Test Cases

When testing the deployed application, verify:

1. All layers can load their categories
2. All categories can load their subcategories
3. Specific problematic combinations work correctly:
   - S.POP.HPM (Stars, Pop, Hip-Hop Music)
   - W.BCH.SUN (Worlds, Beach, Sun)
   - Other combinations noted in previous issues
