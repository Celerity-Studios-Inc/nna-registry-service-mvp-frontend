## Current Status

The application is currently building and deploying via GitHub CI/CD pipeline. The asset registration flow has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Layer Selection**: Properly switches layers with correct categories displayed
2. **Category Loading**: Categories now load automatically when a layer is selected
3. **Subcategory Display**: Subcategories display in a proper grid layout and remain visible after selection
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Interface is more responsive with optimized rendering and reduced logging
5. **HFN/MFA Formats**: Consistent formatting throughout the workflow and on success page

## Issues Fixed

1. **Disappearing Subcategory Cards**:
   - Problem: Subcategory cards would disappear after selecting BAS (Base) subcategory in Star layer
   - Solution: Implemented multi-tiered data preservation system with redundant backups

2. **Layer Switching Regression**:
   - Problem: Previous layer's categories remained visible after switching layers
   - Solution: Enhanced state management with tiered cleanup and verification

3. **Category Loading Regression**:
   - Problem: Categories only appeared after clicking "Retry" button
   - Solution: Enhanced direct loading with automatic retry mechanism

4. **Subcategory Layout Problems**:
   - Problem: Subcategories displayed in a single vertical column
   - Solution: Updated CSS to use grid layout for better space utilization

5. **UI Performance Issues**:
   - Problem: Slow response times with significant lag between clicks and UI updates
   - Solution: Reduced excessive logging, optimized state updates, and improved rendering performance

6. **HFN/MFA Format Issues**:
   - Problem: Inconsistent formats with missing or incorrect numeric codes
   - Solution: Implemented consistent case handling and proper numeric code generation

## Remaining Issues

1. **Duplicate NNA Address Card**: Review/submit page (Step 4) shows two identical NNA address cards
2. **Inconsistent Sequential Number Display**: The .000 suffix is shown inconsistently across steps
3. **Next Button State Management**: The Next button doesn't properly update its state (active/inactive)
4. **Slow File Upload UI Rendering**: Noticeable delay in UI rendering after file upload

## Next Steps

1. Remove the duplicate NNA address card in the Review/Submit step
2. Implement consistent sequential number display throughout the application
3. Fix Next button state management throughout the workflow
4. Optimize file upload UI rendering performance
5. Clean up excessive debugging logs after all functionality is confirmed working

## Technical Details

### Key Features Implemented (Most Recent)

1. **Snapshot Mechanism for Subcategory Preservation**:
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Take a snapshot of current subcategories before any state changes
   const subcategoriesSnapshot = {
     context: [...subcategories],
     direct: [...directSubcategories],
     local: [...localSubcategories],
     ref: [...subcategoriesRef.current]
   };
   
   // Create a guaranteed subcategories list that will survive the state updates
   const guaranteedSubcategoriesList = [source selection logic];
   ```

2. **Enhanced SubcategoriesGrid Component**:
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Keep a local backup of subcategories to prevent disappearing
   const [localGridItems, setLocalGridItems] = React.useState<TaxonomyItem[]>([]);
   
   // Track when subcategories are updated to maintain consistency
   React.useEffect(() => {
     if (subcategories.length > 0) {
       setLocalGridItems(subcategories);
     }
   }, [subcategories]);
   ```

3. **Improved CSS for Subcategory Cards**:
   ```css
   .taxonomy-item.active {
     border-color: #007bff;
     background-color: #e8f4ff;
     transform: translateY(-2px);
     box-shadow: 0 3px 8px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.4);
     z-index: 5; /* Make active item highest */
     position: relative;
     outline: 2px solid #007bff; /* Extra outline to ensure visibility */
   }
   ```
