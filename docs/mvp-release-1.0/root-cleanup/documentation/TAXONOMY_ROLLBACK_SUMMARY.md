# Taxonomy Special Case Handling Rollback Summary

## Changes Implemented

We've successfully rolled back the special case handling in the taxonomy mapping system to make it work consistently across all layer, category, and subcategory combinations. The key changes include:

1. **Restored Original TaxonomySelection Component**:
   - Modified RegisterAssetPage.tsx to use TaxonomySelection instead of DropdownBasedTaxonomySelector
   - Preserved all necessary props to ensure proper functionality

2. **Removed Special Case Handling**:
   - Removed special handling for S.POP.HPM from taxonomyMapper.enhanced.ts
   - Removed special handling for W.BCH.SUN from taxonomyMapper.enhanced.ts
   - Cleaned up other hard-coded special cases

3. **Implemented Generic Code Conversion**:
   - Modified the following methods in taxonomyMapper.enhanced.ts to use the taxonomy service without special cases:
     - convertHFNToMFA
     - convertMFAToHFN
     - formatNNAAddress
     - getCategoryNumericCode
     - getSubcategoryNumericCode
     - getCategoryAlphabeticCode
     - getSubcategoryAlphabeticCode

4. **Built and Verified**:
   - Successfully built the application without TypeScript errors
   - Verified that the build completes successfully

## Benefits

1. **Improved Consistency**: The taxonomy system now works generically across all combinations without special cases, reducing maintenance complexity.

2. **Better Maintainability**: With fewer hard-coded values and special cases, the code is more maintainable and follows a more consistent pattern.

3. **Restored Original Workflow**: The asset registration workflow has been restored to its original 4-step process with Layer cards in Step 1, Dropdowns in Step 2, and asset preview in steps 3 and 4.

## Implementation Details

The implementation focused on removing special case handling while ensuring that the code still functions correctly. We carefully extracted the logic from special cases and replaced it with generic lookup functions that work across all taxonomy combinations.

The key insight was to leverage the existing taxonomy service to look up codes rather than hard-coding specific mappings for certain combinations. This ensures that as the taxonomy evolves, the code will remain functional without requiring constant updates.

## Verification

The changes have been verified by:
1. Successfully compiling the TypeScript code
2. Building the application without errors
3. Testing the development server startup

The changes have been committed and pushed to the main branch, ready for deployment and testing.
