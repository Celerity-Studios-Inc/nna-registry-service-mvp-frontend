# Cursor Review and Test Implementation Prompt

## Overview

We need your assistance with the NNA Registry Frontend application to:
1. Perform a comprehensive codebase review
2. Implement unit tests for key components and services
3. Identify any code quality issues or optimization opportunities

The application is a React TypeScript frontend for an asset registration system that uses a multi-step form process and implements a specialized NNA (Neural Network Architecture) addressing system.

## Key Documents for Reference

Please read these three documents in the `/docs` directory to understand the project structure, recent changes, and test implementation plan:

1. `CURSOR_REVIEW.md` - Provides a detailed overview of the codebase structure, component architecture, and focus areas for review
2. `TEST_PLAN.md` - Outlines a comprehensive testing strategy with specific test cases and implementation approach
3. `FEATURE_UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Details recent UI improvements to the Review & Submit page that need to be validated

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Codebase Review

Perform a comprehensive review of the codebase with special attention to:

- Recently modified components (`ReviewSubmit.tsx` and `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`)
- Component architecture and reusability
- State management approach
- TypeScript implementation
- Error handling
- Performance considerations

Provide feedback on:
- Code quality issues
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Architectural improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Best practices adherence

### 2. Unit Test Implementation

Following the test plan in `TEST_PLAN.md`, implement unit tests for:

#### 2.1. Core Components
- `LayerSelection.tsx`
- `TaxonomySelection.tsx`
- `FileUpload.tsx`
- `ReviewSubmit.tsx` (priority due to recent changes)

#### 2.2. Services
- `assetService.ts`
- `taxonomyService.ts`

#### 2.3. Integration Tests
- Multi-step registration flow

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis

After implementing tests:
- Run tests with coverage reporting
- Identify areas with insufficient coverage
- Implement additional tests to reach coverage goals

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Follow the test structure examples provided in `TEST_PLAN.md`
2. Use Jest and React Testing Library for all tests
3. Organize test files as outlined in the test plan
4. Create mock implementations for API services
5. Test both success and error paths
6. Add detailed comments to explain test cases

## Specific Focus Areas

1. Recent UI changes to the Review & Submit page:
   - Back and Submit button horizontal alignment
   - NNA Address card placement
   - File preview functionality

2. Multi-step form validation:
   - Step progression validation
   - Form submission validation
   - Error handling

3. Component interaction:
   - Parent-child communication
   - State propagation
   - Event handling

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive code review report
2. Fully implemented test suite (following `TEST_PLAN.md`)
3. Documentation of any uncovered issues
4. Recommendations for code quality improvements
5. Coverage report analysis

## Timeline and Priorities

Start with reviewing and testing the recently modified components (`ReviewSubmit.tsx` and `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`) as they contain the most recent changes and are critical to the application flow.

Then proceed with the other components and services according to the test plan.

## Development Environment Setup

The project uses:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material UI v5
- React Hook Form with Yup validation
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing

All required dependencies should be listed in package.json. Use `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies before starting.

## Additional Notes

1. The application currently uses mock implementations for some API services
2. Focus on the asset registration flow as the core feature
3. Pay special attention to the NNA address system implementation
4. The application handles special flows for different asset layers (e.g., Training Data layer 'T')

Thank you for your assistance with this project. Your thoroughness in code review and test implementation will help ensure the application is robust, maintainable, and functions as expected.
