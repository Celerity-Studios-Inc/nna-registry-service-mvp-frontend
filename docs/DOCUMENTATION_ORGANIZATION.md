# Documentation Organization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the organization of documentation files in the NNA Registry Service MVP Frontend project. The goal was to improve the project structure by organizing the many `.md` files that were previously located in the main directory.

## Organization Structure

The documentation has been organized into the following structure:

1. **/docs/review/** - Contains documentation relevant for code review by Claude and Grok
   - Core project documentation
   - Implementation details
   - Taxonomy system documentation
   - Testing and user documentation

2. **/docs/archive/** - Contains older or less critical documentation
   - Fix summaries
   - Implementation notes
   - Deployment documentation
   - API documentation
   - Technical analysis reports
   - Previous reviews

3. **/docs/taxonomy/** - Contains specialized documentation about the taxonomy system
   - Developer guide
   - Troubleshooting
   - UI components

## Key Files

### In /docs/review/

- **README.md** - Documentation index with links to all review documents
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - High-level project description
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Frontend architecture details
- **TAXONOMY_SYSTEM.md** - Taxonomy implementation details
- **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Current project status
- **GAPS_AND_TODOS.md** - Known gaps and pending work
- **TECHNICAL_NOTES.md** - Technical implementation details
- **REVIEW_REQUEST.md** - Request for comprehensive review

Additional files include implementation details, taxonomy system documentation, testing guides, and user documentation.

### In /docs/archive/

- **README.md** - Archive index explaining the contents and purpose
- Various fix summaries, implementation notes, and technical documents

## Documentation Access

To access the most up-to-date documentation for review:
1. Navigate to `/docs/review/`
2. Start with `README.md` which serves as an index
3. Follow the links to specific documents based on areas of interest

For historical documentation:
1. Navigate to `/docs/archive/`
2. Browse files by name or refer to the `README.md` for guidance

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the organized documentation structure:
1. Add new documentation for current features to `/docs/review/`
2. Update the `README.md` in `/docs/review/` when adding new documents
3. Move outdated documentation to `/docs/archive/` when it's no longer current
4. Keep specialized taxonomy documentation in `/docs/taxonomy/`

## Completion Status

The documentation organization task has been completed on May 24, 2025. All `.md` files from the main directory have been categorized and moved to appropriate subdirectories, leaving only the following essential files in the main directory:

1. `README.md` - Main project README
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude.ai/code
3. `TAXONOMY_ROLLBACK_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of taxonomy rollback

The following directories now contain the organized documentation:

1. `/docs/review/` - 29 files containing the most relevant documentation for code review
2. `/docs/archive/` - 200+ files containing historical documentation
3. `/docs/taxonomy/` - Specialized taxonomy system documentation

A comprehensive index has been added to each directory's README.md file to help navigate the documentation.
