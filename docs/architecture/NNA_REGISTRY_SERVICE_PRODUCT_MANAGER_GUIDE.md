## 3. The NNA Taxonomy System

### 3.1 Dual Addressing Innovation

The NNA Framework introduces a breakthrough dual addressing system:

#### **Human-Friendly Names (HFN)**

- **Format**: `[Layer].[Category].[Subcategory].[Sequence].[Type]`
- **Example**: `G.POP.TSW.001.mp3` (Taylor Swift pop song)
- **Purpose**: Intuitive naming for content creators

#### **Machine-Friendly Addresses (MFA)**

- **Format**: `[Layer].[CategoryNum].[SubcategoryNum].[Sequence].[Type]`
- **Example**: `G.003.042.001.mp3` (Same song in numeric format)
- **Purpose**: Optimized for backend processing and AI integration

### 3.2 Asset Layers

The system organizes assets into specialized layers:

| **Layer**     | **Code** | **Purpose**            | **Business Value**                  |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Songs         | G        | Music tracks and audio | Foundation for all remixes          |
| Stars         | S        | Virtual avatars        | User engagement and personalization |
| Looks         | L        | Costumes and styling   | Fashion and brand integration       |
| Moves         | M        | Choreography           | Dance trends and cultural relevance |
| Worlds        | W        | Environments           | Context and atmosphere              |
| Branded       | B        | Product placements     | Revenue generation                  |
| Personalize   | P        | User customizations    | User retention and engagement       |
| Training_Data | T        | AI datasets            | Model improvement and accuracy      |
| Rights        | R        | Licensing information  | Compliance and monetization         |
