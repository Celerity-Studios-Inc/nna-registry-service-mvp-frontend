# Monitoring & Management Dashboard Specification (For Frontend Validation)

## üéØ Purpose
This document proposes a unified monitoring and management dashboard for the NNA Registry Platform. It is designed for validation and feedback by the frontend team. The dashboard will provide real-time system health, user and asset management, and environment selection.

---

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Features
- **Environment Selector**: Switch between development, staging, and production views.
- **System Health & Metrics**: Real-time status, error rates, usage, and performance.
- **User Management**: View, add, edit, delete users; change user roles.
- **Asset Management**: View, search, edit, delete assets; batch operations.
- **Audit & Activity Feed**: Recent actions, errors, and system events.
- **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized users (e.g., admins) can access management functions.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Layout (Proposed)

1. **Header**
   - Environment selector (dropdown: Development, Staging, Production)
   - Current user info & logout

2. **System Overview**
   - Health status (color-coded: green/yellow/red)
   - Uptime, error rate, API response time, DB/storage status
   - Key metrics (asset count, user count, uploads today, etc.)

3. **Tabs/Sections**
   - **Users**: Table with search/filter, add/edit/delete, change role
   - **Assets**: Table with search/filter, view/edit/delete, batch actions
   - **Activity Feed**: Recent logins, asset changes, errors, admin actions
   - **Settings**: (future) System config, environment variables, etc.

## üîå Backend API Endpoints (Proposed)

### **System Health & Metrics**
- `GET /api/health` ‚Äî Enhanced health endpoint (already implemented)
- `GET /api/metrics` ‚Äî Returns:
  - API response times (p95, p99)
  - Error rates (last 24h)
  - Uptime
  - Asset/user counts
  - DB/storage status

### **User Management**
- `GET /api/users` ‚Äî List/search users
- `POST /api/users` ‚Äî Add user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` ‚Äî Edit user (name, email, role)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` ‚Äî Delete user
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/role` ‚Äî Change user role

### **Asset Management**
- `GET /api/assets` ‚Äî List/search assets
- `GET /api/assets/:id` ‚Äî View asset details
- `PUT /api/assets/:id` ‚Äî Edit asset metadata
- `DELETE /api/assets/:id` ‚Äî Delete asset
- `POST /api/assets/batch` ‚Äî Batch operations (delete, update)

### **Activity Feed & Audit**
- `GET /api/activity` ‚Äî Recent actions (user logins, asset changes, errors)

---

## üß© Integration & Environment Selection
- All endpoints support an `environment` query param or header (optional; default to current env)
- Dashboard UI should allow switching environments, triggering API calls to the correct backend
- Backend will enforce RBAC for all management endpoints

---

## ‚úÖ Backend Responsibilities
- Implement all listed API endpoints with RBAC enforcement
- Provide real-time health and metrics data
- Expose audit logs/activity feed
- Ensure endpoints are environment-aware and secure
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- Supply mock data/examples for frontend development

## ‚úÖ Frontend Team Responsibilities
- Review and validate this specification; propose changes as needed
- Design and implement dashboard UI/UX (React/Next.js preferred)
- Integrate with backend APIs (health, metrics, users, assets, activity)
- Implement environment selector and route API calls accordingly
- Implement role-based UI (show/hide management features by user role)
- Provide feedback on API usability and suggest improvements
- Test all management and monitoring flows across environments

## üß™ Testing & Review
- **Backend**: Unit and e2e tests for all endpoints, RBAC, and metrics
- **Frontend**: UI/UX testing, API integration tests, role-based access tests
- **Joint**: End-to-end testing in dev/staging, review sessions for feedback

---

## üìã Next Steps
1. **Frontend team**: Review and comment on this spec
2. **Backend team**: Begin implementation of missing endpoints and metrics
3. **Sync**: Regular check-ins to demo progress and adjust requirements

---

**This dashboard will provide a single pane of glass for system health, user and asset management, and environment control‚Äîempowering both technical and admin users.**

## ‚úÖ **FRONTEND TEAM VALIDATION COMPLETE**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED with Enhancements**  
**Date**: June 28, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Frontend Team  

### **Summary**
The proposed monitoring dashboard specification is **excellent** and aligns perfectly with our three-environment architecture. The core features, API design, and layout proposal are all approved.

### **Enhanced Specification Available**
A comprehensive enhanced specification has been created with additional details:
üìã **Location**: `/docs/for-backend/MONITORING_DASHBOARD_ENHANCED_SPECIFICATION.md`

### **Key Enhancements Added**
1. **Environment Integration**: Leverages existing dev/staging/production setup with visual indicators
2. **Authentication Integration**: Uses current JWT and role-based system  
3. **Taxonomy Service Integration**: Includes management for the new taxonomy service
4. **Enhanced API Endpoints**: More detailed specifications with real examples
5. **Security & Performance Requirements**: Comprehensive operational requirements
6. **Implementation Timeline**: 5-phase rollout plan with clear milestones

### **Ready for Implementation**
‚úÖ **Approved for parallel development** alongside taxonomy service  
‚úÖ **Timeline**: 5 weeks for complete implementation  
‚úÖ **Architecture**: Integrates seamlessly with existing frontend patterns  
‚úÖ **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for production operations  

### **Next Steps**
1. **Backend Team**: Begin implementation using enhanced specification
2. **Frontend Team**: Ready to start UI development when backend APIs are available
3. **Coordination**: Regular sync meetings to ensure alignment

**This monitoring dashboard will provide enterprise-grade operational visibility for the NNA Registry Platform!** üöÄ
