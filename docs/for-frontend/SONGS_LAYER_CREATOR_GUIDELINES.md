# Songs Layer Creator Guidelines: Optimal Pattern Formats

**For Creators**: How to format your Creator's Description for best results  
**Last Updated**: July 15, 2025  
**Applies to**: Songs Layer (G) assets in NNA Registry Service  

## üéØ **Quick Start: Recommended Formats**

### **‚úÖ CANONICAL FORMAT #1 (Highly Recommended)**
```
Song Name - Album Name - Artist Name
```

**Examples**:
- `Bohemian Rhapsody - A Night at the Opera - Queen`
- `Billie Jean - Thriller - Michael Jackson`
- `Hotel California - Hotel California - Eagles`

### **‚úÖ CANONICAL FORMAT #2 (Highly Recommended)**
```
Song Name by Artist from Album Name
```

**Examples**:
- `Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen from A Night at the Opera`
- `Billie Jean by Michael Jackson from Thriller`
- `Hotel California by Eagles from Hotel California`

## üìã **Comprehensive Pattern Support**

Our system supports **20 different patterns** to handle various Creator's Description formats. However, using the canonical formats above will give you the best results for:
- **Album art lookup** from iTunes and music databases
- **AI metadata generation** with accurate song, artist, and album information
- **Enhanced searchability** and discoverability

### **Pattern Categories**

#### **üü¢ HIGH PRIORITY (Recommended)**
These patterns provide the best results for AI processing and album art integration:

1. **`Song Name - Album Name - Artist Name`** ‚úÖ **CANONICAL #1**
2. **`Song Name by Artist from Album Name`** ‚úÖ **CANONICAL #2**
3. **`"Song Name" by Artist from album "Album Name"`** (with quotes)
4. **`"Song Name" by Artist from album Album Name`** (partial quotes)
5. **`Song Name - Artist Name (Album Name)`** (parentheses for album)
6. **`Song Name (from Album Name) by Artist Name`** (from syntax)

#### **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Acceptable)**
These patterns work well but may not capture all information:

7. **`"Song Name" by Artist`** (quotes, no album)
8. **`Song Name by Artist`** (simple, no album)
9. **`Artist Name - Song Name`** (artist first)
10. **`Artist Name: Song Name`** (colon format)
11. **`Song Name (Artist Name)`** (parentheses for artist)
12. **`Song Name [Artist Name]`** (brackets for artist)

#### **üü† LOW PRIORITY (Fallback)**
These patterns provide basic functionality:

13. **`Song Name | Artist Name`** (pipe separator)
14. **`Song Name / Artist Name`** (slash separator)
15. **`Song Name feat. Artist Name`** (featuring format)
16. **`Song Name featuring Artist Name`** (full featuring)
17. **`Song Name with Artist Name`** (collaboration)
18. **`Album Name - Artist Name - Song Name`** (album first)
19. **`Song Name - Artist`** (simple dash)
20. **`Song Name`** (song name only)

    artistName: "Queen"
  },

```

## üö® **Common Issues to Avoid**

### **‚ùå Ambiguous Formats**
- `Track 01` (no song information)
- `Unknown - Unknown - Unknown` (placeholder text)
- `song.mp3` (filename only)
- `My favorite song` (too vague)

### **‚ùå Inconsistent Separators**
- `Song Name -- Album Name -- Artist Name` (double dashes)
- `Song Name, Album Name, Artist Name` (commas - confusing)
- `Song Name | Album Name | Artist Name` (pipes - less optimal)

### **‚ùå Missing Information**
- `Song Name - - Artist Name` (missing album)
- `Song Name - Album Name -` (missing artist)
- `- Album Name - Artist Name` (missing song)

## üí° **Pro Tips for Creators**

### **1. Use Complete Information**
Even if the album name is the same as the song name, include it:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Hotel California - Hotel California - Eagles"
‚ùå Avoid: "Hotel California - Eagles"
```

### **2. Handle Special Characters**
Our system handles quotes, apostrophes, and special characters:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Don't Stop Believin' - Escape - Journey"
‚úÖ Good: "What's Up? - Bigger, Better, Faster, More! - 4 Non Blondes"
```

### **3. Collaboration and Featuring**
For songs with multiple artists:
```
‚úÖ Recommended: "Under Pressure - Hot Space - Queen & David Bowie"
‚úÖ Alternative: "Under Pressure feat. David Bowie - Hot Space - Queen"
```

### **4. Live Versions and Variants**
Be specific about versions:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Bohemian Rhapsody (Live) - Live at Wembley - Queen"
‚úÖ Good: "Stairway to Heaven (Remastered) - Led Zeppelin IV - Led Zeppelin"
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Pattern Matching System**
Our system uses a **priority-based matching system** that:

1. **Sorts patterns by priority** (high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low ‚Üí lowest)
2. **Attempts canonical patterns first** for best results
3. **Provides feedback** on pattern quality during asset creation
4. **Logs pattern match results** for debugging and improvement

### **Real-time Feedback**
When you enter a Creator's Description, you'll see:
- **‚úÖ Canonical format detected** (best quality)
- **‚úÖ High-quality pattern** (excellent results)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-quality pattern** (good results, consider canonical format)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Low-quality pattern** (basic results, recommend canonical format)

## üìä **Migration Support**

### **For Existing Assets**
If you have existing Songs layer assets without proper Creator's Descriptions:

1. **Use the Edit Details page** to add Creator's Descriptions
2. **Follow canonical formats** for best results
3. **Add album art URLs** using the enhanced album art editing feature
4. **Save changes** to trigger pattern matching and AI enhancement

### **Bulk Migration Assistant**
For creators with many assets, consider:
- **Batch editing** using the migration assistant interface
- **Pattern suggestions** based on existing asset names
- **Album art lookup** integration for automatic enhancement

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **With Canonical Formats**
- **Album art appears** automatically in asset thumbnails
- **Enhanced AI descriptions** with music-specific context
- **Better search results** when users look for similar songs
- **Professional appearance** in asset listings and details

### **Quality Metrics**

- **Album art integration**: 80%+ success rate for popular songs
- **AI description quality**: Significantly improved with structured input
- **Search relevance**: Better matching across Songs layer assets

## üÜò **Need Help?**

### **If Pattern Matching Fails**
1. Check that your format matches one of the 20 supported patterns
2. Try one of the canonical formats: `Song Name - Album Name - Artist Name`
3. Ensure complete information (song, album, artist all present)
4. Avoid special characters that might break parsing

### **If Album Art Doesn't Load**
1. Verify the song/album/artist information is accurate
2. Check if the song exists in iTunes/music databases
3. Manually add album art URL using the Edit Details page
4. Report persistent issues for system improvement
