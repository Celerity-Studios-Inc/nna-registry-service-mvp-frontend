# Success Page HFN/MFA Format Fix

## Problem

After implementing the fix for subcategory selection and HFN/MFA formatting during the asset registration process, we encountered an issue with the success page displaying incorrect formats:

1. **Human-Friendly Name (HFN) Issue:**
   - Expected: `S.POP.HPM.026`
   - Actual: `S.POP.POP_HIPSTER_MALE_STARS.026`
   - Problem: Subcategory was using the full name instead of the 3-letter code

2. **Machine-Friendly Address (MFA) Issue:**
   - Expected: `2.001.007.026`
   - Actual: `S.001.007.026`
   - Problem: Layer was using the letter code instead of the numeric code

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because the success page was:

1. Using the display name from the backend response (`Pop_Hipster_Male_Stars`) rather than the actual subcategory code (`HPM`) that was used during the asset creation.

2. Using different formatting logic than what was used during asset creation, leading to inconsistent results.

3. Not properly converting letter layer codes (S) to numeric codes (2) in the MFA display.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix:

1. **Use Original Form Values:**
   - Instead of trying to reconstruct codes from the backend response, we now use the original subcategory code that was saved in the form state.
   - This ensures the same code used for asset creation is used for display.

2. **Use taxonomyFormatter Directly:**
   - We replaced the use of `taxonomyMapper.formatNNAAddress` with direct calls to our enhanced `taxonomyFormatter` for consistency.
   - The same formatter is now used throughout the application.

3. **Enhanced MFA Formatting:**
   - Updated `formatMFA` to detect and convert letter layer codes (S) to numeric codes (2).
   - Added better logging for debugging formatting issues.

4. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added fallback mechanisms when formatting fails.
   - Enhanced diagnostic logging to better track down any future issues.

## Code Changes

1. In `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`:
   - Modified the success page code to use the last saved form values for formatting.
   - Replaced taxonomyMapper with direct calls to taxonomyFormatter.
   - Added enhanced logging for better debugging.

2. In `taxonomyFormatter.ts`:
   - Enhanced `formatMFA` to properly handle letter layer codes (S â†’ 2).
   - Improved error handling and logging.

## Expected Results

The success page should now correctly display:
- HFN: `S.POP.HPM.026` (using the 3-letter subcategory code)
- MFA: `2.001.007.026` (using the numeric layer code)

This fix ensures consistent formatting throughout the entire asset registration flow.
