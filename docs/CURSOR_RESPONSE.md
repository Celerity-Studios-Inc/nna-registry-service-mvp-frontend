# Responses to Cursor's Clarifying Questions

Thank you for your thorough review of the documentation. Your understanding of the project and requirements is spot on. Here are the responses to your clarifying questions:

## Mock Data/Services

**Approach**: Continue using the current mock implementations for assetService and taxonomyService in tests, but feel free to refactor them into a more maintainable pattern. We don't need to introduce MSW at this stage, but if you think it would significantly improve the testing architecture, you can suggest it as a future improvement.

**Note**: We want to ensure our tests will be resilient to future API changes, so design your test mocks with that in mind.

## Accessibility Testing

**Focus**: Add accessibility (jest-axe) tests for the main components in the registration flow, especially the `ReviewSubmit.tsx` component and any UI components that users interact with directly. You don't need to test every utility component for accessibility, but focus on user-facing views.

**Priority**: This is not the highest priority - focus on functional tests first, then add accessibility tests if time permits.

## Edge Cases

**Priority Edge Cases**:

1. **Duplicate NNA Address Detection**: Verify that the UI correctly shows warnings when a potentially duplicate asset is detected, with the correct confidence level.
2. **File Type Previews**: Test handling of different file types in the preview functionality.
3. **Form Validation**: Ensure that invalid inputs are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed.
4. **Step Navigation**: Test that users can't proceed to the next step without completing required fields.
5. **Training Layer Flow**: Test the conditional step for training data when the "T" layer is selected.

## Test File Placement

**Approach**: Place test files alongside their components (e.g., `ReviewSubmit.test.tsx` in the same folder as `ReviewSubmit.tsx`). This makes it easier to maintain tests when components change and keeps related files together.

**Note**: For integration tests that span multiple components, you can create a `__tests__/integration` directory in the `src` folder.

## Service Layer

**Focus**: Service tests should focus primarily on the current mock implementations to ensure they're working correctly. When writing these tests, design them so they can be easily adapted for real API integration tests in the future.

**Structure**: Structure your test files in a way that would allow us to swap mock implementations with real API calls with minimal changes to the test files.

## Success Page

**Scope**: The success page after registration is in scope for this review and testing. It's an important part of the user flow and should be tested to ensure it displays the correct information (especially HFN/MFA values) after a successful registration.

**Priority**: It's a secondary priority after the main registration flow components, but should be included in the test coverage.

## Additional Instructions

1. **Test Readability**: Focus on making tests readable and maintainable with clear assertions and descriptive test names.

2. **Documentation**: Add comments to complex test setup or assertions to explain the reasoning.

3. **Incremental Approach**: Start with the most critical components (`ReviewSubmit.tsx` and `RegisterAssetPage.tsx`), then expand to other components based on priority.

4. **Report Structure**: When you provide your code review, please include:
   - Overall architecture assessment
   - Component-specific feedback
   - Code quality issues
   - Performance considerations
   - Recommended improvements (prioritized by impact)

5. **Test Coverage**: Aim for 85%+ coverage overall, with higher coverage for critical components.

Thank you for these thoughtful questions. Please proceed with the code review and test implementation based on these guidelines. If you have any additional questions as you work, please don't hesitate to ask.
