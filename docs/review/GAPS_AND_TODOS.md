# NNA Registry Service - Gaps and TODOs

## Overview

This document outlines the identified gaps between the current implementation and the project requirements, along with a prioritized list of tasks to address these gaps.

## Major Gaps

### 1. Composite Asset Handling

**Current Status**: The frontend treats composite assets (C layer) the same as component assets, which is incorrect. Composite assets should have a different registration flow that allows for the selection of component assets.

**Requirements Gap**: The NNA Framework specifies that composite assets should reference component assets and provide a composition structure.

**Impact**: Users cannot properly register composite assets with their component relationships.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design specialized UI for composite asset registration
- [ ] Implement component asset selection interface
- [ ] Create visualization of composite structure
- [ ] Update backend integration for composite asset handling
- [ ] Add validation for composite asset relationships

### 2. Asset Search and Browse Functionality

**Current Status**: Basic search and browse functionality is partially implemented, but lacks advanced features and proper integration.

**Requirements Gap**: The requirements specify comprehensive search and browse capabilities with filtering, sorting, and faceted search.

**Impact**: Users have limited ability to find and explore assets in the system.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement advanced search with multiple criteria
- [ ] Add faceted search functionality
- [ ] Create filter and sort options
- [ ] Improve search results display
- [ ] Implement saved searches
- [ ] Enhance browse view with grid/list toggle
- [ ] Add pagination controls

### 3. User Management and Permissions

**Current Status**: Basic authentication is implemented, but user management and permissions are limited.

**Requirements Gap**: The system should support different user roles and permissions for asset management.

**Impact**: Limited ability to control access and permissions for different users.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement user profile management
- [ ] Create role-based permission system
- [ ] Add team/organization features
- [ ] Implement user settings
- [ ] Create admin interface for user management

### 4. Asset Versioning

**Current Status**: No versioning functionality is implemented. Assets are treated as single instances.

**Requirements Gap**: The requirements mention support for asset versioning and history.

**Impact**: Users cannot track changes to assets or manage versions.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design version history interface
- [ ] Implement version comparison
- [ ] Add rollback functionality
- [ ] Create branch/variant support
- [ ] Implement version metadata

### 5. Batch Operations

**Current Status**: All operations are single-asset focused with no batch capabilities.

**Requirements Gap**: The system should support batch operations for efficiency.

**Impact**: Users must perform repetitive operations for multiple assets.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement multi-select functionality
- [ ] Create bulk upload interface
- [ ] Add batch editing capabilities
- [ ] Implement batch download
- [ ] Create batch status monitoring

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 6. Dashboard and Analytics

**Impact**: Limited visibility into system usage and asset status.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add asset statistics and metrics
- [ ] Implement recent activity feed
- [ ] Create quick action buttons
- [ ] Add customizable widgets
- [ ] Implement usage analytics

### 7. API Integration Completeness

**Current Status**: Core API endpoints are integrated, but some still use mock data.

**Requirements Gap**: All features should use real backend data.

**Impact**: Some features may not work correctly in production.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Complete integration for all endpoints
- [ ] Enhance error handling for API calls
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Improve loading states
- [ ] Create comprehensive API tests

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness

**Current Status**: Basic responsiveness implemented but with issues on smaller screens.

**Requirements Gap**: The application should be fully usable on mobile devices.

**Impact**: Reduced usability on mobile devices.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Improve responsive layouts
- [ ] Optimize for touch interfaces
- [ ] Create mobile-specific views where needed
- [ ] Test on various devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Implement touch gestures

### 9. Offline Support

**Current Status**: No offline support. Application requires constant connection.

**Requirements Gap**: Some operations should work offline.

**Impact**: Users cannot work when connectivity is limited.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement offline data storage
- [ ] Add sync mechanism for offline changes
- [ ] Create conflict resolution
- [ ] Add offline indicators
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation

### 10. Performance Optimization

**Current Status**: Performance issues with large datasets and complex operations.

**Requirements Gap**: The application should be responsive and efficient.

**Impact**: Degraded user experience with larger datasets.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement virtualized lists for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize component rendering
- [ ] Add request caching
- [ ] Implement data prefetching
- [ ] Reduce bundle size

## Lower Priority Gaps

### 11. Localization

**Current Status**: No localization support. UI is English-only.

**Requirements Gap**: Support for multiple languages is mentioned in future requirements.

**Impact**: Limited accessibility for non-English users.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up i18n framework
- [ ] Extract text for translation
- [ ] Implement language switching
- [ ] Add RTL support
- [ ] Create localization guidelines

### 12. Advanced UI Features

**Current Status**: Basic UI with limited advanced features.

**Impact**: Reduced productivity and user satisfaction.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop interfaces
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create context menus
- [ ] Implement tooltips and guided tours
- [ ] Add customizable themes

### 13. Reporting

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling approaches vary across components
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Some components lack proper documentation
3. **Test Coverage**: Limited automated test coverage
4. **CSS Organization**: CSS needs better organization and consistency
5. **Component Reusability**: Some components have too many responsibilities
6. **Type Safety**: Some areas use `any` types instead of proper typing
7. **Code Duplication**: Similar functionality implemented in multiple places
8. **Bundle Size**: Application bundle size needs optimization
9. **Legacy Components**: Some components use outdated patterns
10. **Configuration Management**: Environment configuration needs improvement
