# NNA Registry Service - Recent Changes and Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent changes and improvements made to the NNA Registry Service frontend application. The focus has been on enhancing stability, user experience, and fixing critical issues in the taxonomy selection system.

## Taxonomy System Refactoring

### Phase 1-3: Architecture Design and Component Creation (Completed)
- Created a new architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  1. `TaxonomyDataProvider`: Centralized data provider for taxonomy operations
  2. `TaxonomySelector`: Stateless UI component for rendering the taxonomy interface
  3. Supporting components: `LayerGrid`, `CategoryGrid`, `SubcategoryGrid`

### Phase 4-5: Integration with Register Asset Page (Completed)
- Created a new implementation of RegisterAssetPage with the new architecture
- Implemented adapter methods for interface conversion
- Added feature toggle for switching between implementations
- Removed special case handling in favor of generic approaches
- Enhanced form state management with React Hook Form

### Phase 6-7: Main App Integration and Testing (Completed)
- Implemented feature toggle system for UI version selection
- Created comprehensive test plan and verification process
- Conducted testing focused on problematic combinations
- Created automated test scripts for critical testing
- All critical issues were verified as fixed in the new implementation

### Phase 8: Final Cleanup and Rollout (Completed)
- Removed feature toggle from the application
- Cleaned up old implementation components
- Applied code optimization techniques:
  - Added memoization with React.useMemo and React.useCallback
  - Enhanced logger utility for conditional debug output
  - Applied React.memo with custom comparison
  - Optimized data structures with lookup tables

## Taxonomy UI Improvements

### Step Numbering
- Updated step numbering for clarity:
  - Changed "Step 2: Select Category" to "Step 2.1: Select Category"
  - Changed "Step 3: Select Subcategory" to "Step 2.2: Select Subcategory"
  - Aligns sub-steps with main workflow Step 2 "Choose Taxonomy"

### UI Layout and Display
- Increased taxonomy card height and improved label display:
  - Changed from single-line truncation to multi-line display (2 lines max)
  - Increased card width from 130px to 150px minimum
  - Enhanced text rendering with word-break and better line height
  - Added padding to ensure text doesn't touch card edges

### Selection Display
- Centered taxonomy selection chip in navigation footer:
  - Removed standalone selection chip from top section
  - Added navigation footer with centered selection chip
  - Improved visual consistency with navigation buttons
  - Added subtle border to separate navigation area

### Layer Display Consistency
- Updated the Selected Taxonomy display to show layer in consistent format:
  - Layer code appears in a chip, followed by the layer name
  - Matches the format used for category and subcategory
  - Added getLayerName helper function for proper display

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Subcategory Disappearance
- Fixed issue where selecting certain subcategories caused others to disappear:
  - Implemented multi-tiered approach to data preservation
  - Added snapshot mechanism to capture data before state changes
  - Created guaranteed subcategory list from multiple sources
  - Added special case handling for problematic combinations

### Layer Switching Regression
- Fixed issue when switching between layers causing display of wrong categories:
  - Implemented comprehensive approach to layer switching
  - Added unique operation IDs for cross-component tracing
  - Enhanced event handling with improved sequencing
  - Added multiple fallback mechanisms with session storage backup

### React Error #301
- Fixed "updating unmounted component" error:
  - Added comprehensive error handling system
  - Implemented throttling for layer selection events
  - Enhanced components with unmount safety checks
  - Added global taxonomy error handler to prevent app crashes

### State Persistence
- Implemented reliable state persistence:
  - Created SelectionStorage utility with sessionStorage
  - Added EventCoordinator for state sequencing
  - Added navigation warnings for unsaved changes
  - Implemented automatic state saving and restoration

### HFN Format Fix
- Fixed incorrect HFN format on success page:
  - Updated taxonomyFormatter utility to use direct lookups
  - Added methods to get canonical codes from taxonomy data
  - Enhanced formatHFN with better taxonomy integration
  - Maintained special case handling for known edge cases

## UI/UX Improvements

### Grid Layout Fix
- Fixed subcategory cards displaying in a single column:
  - Enhanced CSS with maximum specificity selectors
  - Added explicit inline grid styles to components
  - Fixed parent container layout for consistency
  - Added responsive grid adjustments for different screen sizes

### Error Handling
- Improved error handling and recovery:
  - Created TaxonomyErrorRecovery component
  - Added automatic recovery mechanisms
  - Enhanced ErrorBoundary to support function fallbacks
  - Added global error handler setup

### Performance Optimization
- Enhanced application performance:
  - Replaced console.logs with debugLog utility
  - Added memoization with React.useMemo
  - Applied React.memo with custom comparison functions
  - Improved performance with stable event handler references

### Debugging Tools
- Enhanced debugging capabilities:
  - Added TaxonomyDebugger component
  - Created verboseLog function for controllable logging
  - Added debug mode toggle in development environment
  - Enhanced error diagnostics with operation IDs

## Emergency Features

### Emergency Asset Registration
- Implemented reliable fallback for asset registration:
  - Created EmergencyTaxonomyAdapter for simplified access
  - Implemented EmergencyAssetRegistrationPage
  - Added simplified taxonomy selection interface
  - Created route at /emergency-register for direct access
