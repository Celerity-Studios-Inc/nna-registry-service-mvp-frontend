# Three-Tier Workflow Implementation

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required for Release 1.2.0

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the proper three-tier promotion workflow for the NNA Registry Service Frontend, addressing the critical issue of pushing directly to main branch without proper testing through development and staging environments.

## Problem Identified

**Critical Issue:** The frontend was violating three-tier promotion best practices by pushing directly to the main branch, causing immediate deployment to all environments (development, staging, and production) without proper testing.

**User Feedback:** "As a best practice, you should be pushing to development for testing before pushing onto staging and production. That's the purpose of the three-tier environment."

## Solution Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows Created

Three separate CI/CD workflows have been created to support the proper three-tier promotion flow:

#### **Development Workflow** (`ci-cd-dev.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Push to `development` branch
- **Environment:** Development
- **Deployment:** `https://nna-registry-frontend-dev.vercel.app`
- **Backend:** `https://nna-registry-service-dev-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`
- **Purpose:** Continuous integration for active development

#### **Staging Workflow** (`ci-cd-stg.yml`)  
- **Trigger:** Push to `staging` branch
- **Environment:** Staging
- **Deployment:** `https://nna-registry-frontend-stg.vercel.app`
- **Backend:** `https://nna-registry-service-staging-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`
- **Purpose:** Pre-production validation and QA
- **Features:** Manual approval gate for production promotion

#### **Production Workflow** (`ci-cd-prod.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch  
- **Environment:** Production
- **Deployment:** `https://nna-registry-frontend.vercel.app`
- **Backend:** `https://nna-registry-service-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`
- **Purpose:** Production deployment with enhanced security checks
- **Features:** Security audit, extended health checks, rollback procedures

### 2. Branch Structure Verification

The proper three-tier branch structure is already in place:
- ✅ `development` (current working branch)
- ✅ `staging` (pre-production branch)
- ✅ `main` (production branch)

### 3. Promotion Flow Implementation

**Proper Workflow:**
```
development → staging → main
    ↓           ↓        ↓
    Dev       Staging  Production
```

**Process:**
1. **Development:** All feature work happens on `development` branch
2. **Staging Promotion:** PR from `development` → `staging` for pre-production testing
3. **Production Promotion:** PR from `staging` → `main` for production release

## Workflow Features

### Enhanced Testing & Security
- TypeScript compilation checks
- ESLint code quality checks
- Security audits (production only)
- Build verification
- Health checks post-deployment

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- **Development:** Rapid iteration, basic health checks
- **Staging:** Extended testing, manual approval gates
- **Production:** Full security suite, extended health checks, rollback procedures

### Deployment Safety
- Artifact-based deployments
- Environment-specific health checks
- Backend connectivity verification
- Automated rollback triggers on failure

## Required GitHub Secrets

Each environment requires specific Vercel project configuration:

```yaml
# Common secrets
VERCEL_TOKEN: <vercel-auth-token>
VERCEL_ORG_ID: <organization-id>

# Environment-specific project IDs
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: <production-project-id>
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STG: <staging-project-id>  
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DEV: <development-project-id>
```

## Environment Protection Rules

### GitHub Repository Settings Required:
1. **Branch Protection:**
   - `main` branch: Require PR reviews, no direct pushes
   - `staging` branch: Require PR reviews, no direct pushes
   - `development` branch: Allow direct pushes for development workflow

2. **Environment Protection:**
   - `production`: Manual approval required
   - `staging-approval`: Manual approval for promotion to production
   - `production-rollback`: Emergency rollback approval

## Migration Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. ✅ **Create Workflow Files** - Completed
2. ⏳ **Configure GitHub Secrets** - Required before deployment
3. ⏳ **Set Branch Protection Rules** - Required for enforcement
4. ⏳ **Configure Vercel Projects** - Required for environment separation

### Verification Steps:
1. Test development deployment from `development` branch
2. Test staging promotion via PR from `development` → `staging`
3. Test production promotion via PR from `staging` → `main`
4. Verify environment isolation and health checks

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Proper Testing Flow:** All changes tested in development before staging
✅ **Environment Isolation:** Each environment has dedicated deployment pipeline
✅ **Manual Approval Gates:** Human oversight for staging and production promotions
✅ **Automated Health Checks:** Post-deployment verification
✅ **Rollback Procedures:** Emergency rollback capabilities for production
✅ **Security Enhancements:** Production-specific security audits and checks

## Backend Coordination

This frontend three-tier implementation aligns with the backend team's three-tier strategy as documented in:
- `docs/for-backend/THREE_ENVIRONMENT_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/architecture/THREE_ENVIRONMENT_PROMOTION_FLOW.md`

## Next Steps for Release 1.2.0

1. **Complete GitHub Configuration** - Set up secrets and branch protection
2. **Backend Team Alignment** - Ensure synchronized promotion workflow
3. **Testing Validation** - Execute full three-tier promotion test
4. **Documentation Update** - Update developer guidelines for new workflow
5. **Team Training** - Brief development team on new promotion process

## Status

**Implementation:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Testing:** ⏳ **PENDING GITHUB CONFIGURATION**  
**Production Ready:** ⏳ **PENDING VALIDATION**

The three-tier workflow violation has been addressed with a comprehensive CI/CD solution that enforces proper development → staging → production promotion flow.
