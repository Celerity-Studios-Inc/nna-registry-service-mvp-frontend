# Frontend Three-Tier Promotion Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Backend Alignment**  
**Priority:** HIGH - Release 1.2.0 Coordination

## Executive Summary

The frontend has implemented a comprehensive three-tier promotion strategy (Development → Staging → Production) with automated CI/CD workflows. This document outlines the strategy for backend team alignment and provides recommendations for synchronized releases.

## Problem Statement

**Previous Issue:** Frontend was pushing directly to main branch, causing immediate deployment to all environments without proper testing through development and staging phases.

**User Feedback:** "As a best practice, you should be pushing to development for testing before pushing onto staging and production. That's the purpose of the three-tier environment."

**Solution:** Implemented proper three-tier promotion workflow with branch-based deployments and approval gates.

## Frontend Three-Tier Architecture

### **Environment Structure**

| Environment | Branch | URL | Backend URL | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Development** | `development` | `https://nna-registry-frontend-dev.vercel.app` | `https://nna-registry-service-dev-297923701246.us-central1.run.app` | Active development and integration |
| **Staging** | `staging` | `https://nna-registry-frontend-stg.vercel.app` | `https://nna-registry-service-staging-297923701246.us-central1.run.app` | Pre-production validation and QA |
| **Production** | `main` | `https://nna-registry-frontend.vercel.app` | `https://nna-registry-service-297923701246.us-central1.run.app` | Live production environment |

### **Promotion Flow**

```
Feature Development → Development → Staging → Production
        ↓                ↓           ↓          ↓
   feature/* branch → development → staging → main
        ↓                ↓           ↓          ↓
    Local Testing    → Dev Deploy → Stg Deploy → Prod Deploy
```

## Implementation Details

### **1. GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### **Development Workflow** (`ci-cd-dev.yml`)
```yaml
Triggers: Push to development branch
Environment: Development
Deployment: Automatic
Health Checks: Basic
Approval Required: None
Purpose: Continuous integration for active development
```

#### **Staging Workflow** (`ci-cd-stg.yml`)
```yaml
Triggers: Push to staging branch (via PR from development)
Environment: Staging
Deployment: Automatic after tests pass
Health Checks: Extended backend connectivity tests
Approval Required: Manual approval gate for production promotion
Purpose: Pre-production validation and QA testing
```

#### **Production Workflow** (`ci-cd-prod.yml`)
```yaml
Triggers: Push to main branch (via PR from staging)
Environment: Production
Deployment: Requires manual approval
Health Checks: Comprehensive security audit + load testing
Approval Required: Production environment protection
Purpose: Live production deployment with enhanced safety
```

### **2. Branch Protection Rules**

#### **Implemented Protection:**
- ✅ `main` branch: Requires PR review, no direct pushes
- ✅ `staging` branch: Requires PR review, no direct pushes  
- ✅ `development` branch: Direct pushes allowed for development workflow
- ✅ Environment protection rules with manual approval gates

#### **Approval Gates:**
- **Development → Staging:** Manual PR review required
- **Staging → Production:** Manual approval + environment protection
- **Emergency Rollback:** Dedicated rollback approval environment

### **3. Deployment Safety Features**

#### **Testing & Validation:**
- TypeScript compilation checks on all branches
- ESLint code quality validation
- Security audits (production only)
- Build verification and artifact validation
- Environment-specific health checks

#### **Health Monitoring:**
- Post-deployment health verification
- Backend connectivity testing
- Frontend load testing (production)
- Automatic rollback triggers on failure

## Backend Coordination Requirements

### **Synchronized Promotion Strategy**

**Recommendation:** Backend should implement parallel three-tier strategy to ensure environment consistency.

#### **Environment Alignment:**
| Frontend Environment | Backend Environment | Synchronization |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `development` branch | `dev` branch | Automatic deployment |
| `staging` branch | `staging` branch | Coordinated promotion |
| `main` branch | `main` branch | Synchronized release |

#### **Release Coordination:**
1. **Development Phase:** Independent development on respective `development`/`dev` branches
2. **Staging Promotion:** Coordinated PR creation: `development` → `staging` (frontend) + `dev` → `staging` (backend)
3. **Production Release:** Synchronized PR creation: `staging` → `main` (both repositories)

### **Backend Three-Tier Implementation Recommendations**

#### **Branch Structure:**
```
backend/dev → backend/staging → backend/main
     ↓             ↓               ↓
   Dev API     Staging API    Production API
```

#### **Environment URLs (Current):**
- **Development:** `https://nna-registry-service-dev-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`
- **Staging:** `https://nna-registry-service-staging-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`  
- **Production:** `https://nna-registry-service-297923701246.us-central1.run.app`

#### **CI/CD Workflow Recommendations:**
1. **Development CI/CD:** Automatic deployment on push to `dev` branch
2. **Staging CI/CD:** Manual promotion from `dev` → `staging` with integration tests
3. **Production CI/CD:** Manual promotion from `staging` → `main` with full test suite

## Coordination Processes

### **Daily Development Workflow**
1. **Frontend & Backend:** Independent development on `development`/`dev` branches
2. **Automatic Deployment:** Both systems deploy automatically to development environment
3. **Integration Testing:** Continuous testing between frontend-dev and backend-dev

### **Weekly Staging Promotion**
1. **Coordination Meeting:** Frontend and backend teams align on promotion readiness
2. **Synchronized PR Creation:** Both teams create PRs: `development`/`dev` → `staging`
3. **Integration Testing:** Full frontend-backend integration testing on staging environment
4. **QA Validation:** User acceptance testing on staging environment

### **Release Production Deployment**
1. **Release Planning:** Joint planning for production release
2. **Pre-deployment Checklist:** Synchronized verification of staging environment health
3. **Coordinated Promotion:** Simultaneous PRs: `staging` → `main` (both repositories)
4. **Production Validation:** Joint health checks and rollback procedures if needed
