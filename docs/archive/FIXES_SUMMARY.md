# Asset Creation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Mock Mode Detection**
   - Added `apiConfig.useMockApi` flag in api.ts
   - Added localStorage override with 'forceMockApi' key
   - Fixed asset creation to respect these settings
   - Added force real mode check with explicit localStorage verification

2. **Field Naming Issues**
   - Fixed `categoryCode` → `category` in API requests
   - Fixed `subcategoryCode` → `subcategory` in API requests
   - Ensured `source` field has default 'ReViz' value
   - Ensured `components` field uses proper format (`JSON.stringify([])`)

3. **Logo Image Fix**
   - Replaced empty logo files with proper images
   - Updated manifest.json app name to better reflect the application

## Current Status

Asset creation now correctly attempts to use the real API implementation when:
1. localStorage has `forceMockApi=false`
2. The backend is available
3. A valid auth token exists

The current workflow:
1. `localStorage.setItem("forceMockApi", "false")` in browser console
2. Real API implementation is activated (shows "Asset creation mode: Real API" in logs)
3. Asset data is properly formatted with correct field names (category, subcategory)
4. FormData is constructed with all required fields in proper format

## Verification

To verify the fixes, you can:

1. Set localStorage override:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem("forceMockApi", "false");
   ```

2. Create an asset through the UI
   - You should see "Asset creation mode: Real API" in the console
   - It will attempt to use the real backend API
   - If there are validation errors (like category being empty), it will fall back to mock implementation

3. Check console logs for:
   ```
   Asset creation mode: Real API
   Force real mode: true
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining API Issues**:
   - Ensure category and subcategory values are properly populated in the form data
   - Test with various layer/category/subcategory combinations
   - Verify UI properly assigns these values before submission

2. **Taxonomy Validation**:
   - Work with backend team to understand valid taxonomy combinations
   - Update frontend to match backend expectations for subcategory values

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error feedback in the UI for API validation failures
   - Show clear error messages for each field that fails validation
