# Asset Registration Testing and Verification

This document summarizes the work done to verify and test the asset registration functionality with the backend API.

## 1. Fixed TypeScript Errors

- Fixed `FormData.entries()` iteration TypeScript errors in `assetService.ts`
- Used static console logging for FormData keys to avoid issues with the FormDataEntryValue iterator
- Resolved build failures related to TypeScript errors

## 2. Updated API Proxy Implementation

- Enhanced the proxy implementation in `api/proxy.ts` to properly handle all API routes
- Created specialized asset handling in `api/assets.ts` for multipart/form-data requests
- Ensured proper content-type preservation for file uploads
- Added detailed error logging and troubleshooting information

## 3. Created Test Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `direct-api-test.mjs` | Test direct API calls to backend |
| `test-asset-creation.js` | Test asset creation via proxy |
| `complete-api-test.mjs` | Comprehensive test of all endpoints |

These scripts verify:
- Authentication with the backend
- File upload functionality
- Asset creation with the required fields
- GET asset endpoint functionality

## 4. Enhanced Documentation

- Updated `API_TESTING.md` with detailed testing instructions
- Updated `README.md` with information about testing API integration
- Created detailed troubleshooting guidelines for common issues

## 5. Configuration Updates

- Updated `.env` to use the real backend API by default (REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=false)
- Added detailed comments in the code about FormData structure requirements
- Verified correct proxy configuration in `vercel.json`

## 6. Backend API Requirements

For successful asset creation, the following fields are required:

- `file`: The file to upload (as FormData)
- `name`: Asset name
- `layer`: Layer code (e.g., "S" for Stars)
- `category`: Category code (e.g., "POP")
- `subcategory`: Subcategory code (e.g., "BAS")
- `tags[]`: At least one tag
- `trainingData`: JSON object for training data
- `rights`: JSON object with source and rights_split
- `components[]`: Empty array or component references

## 7. Authentication Requirements

- All API requests require a valid JWT token
- Token must be included in the Authorization header as "Bearer TOKEN"
- Tests verify token validity and appropriate error handling for invalid tokens

## Testing Instructions

To verify asset registration end-to-end:

1. Run the test script with a valid token:
   ```bash
   node complete-api-test.mjs YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

2. Test via the UI:
   - Start the application: `npm start`
   - Log in with valid credentials
   - Navigate to "Register Asset"
   - Follow the registration workflow
   - Verify the asset is created and appears in the dashboard

## Future Considerations

1. Automated integration tests with Jest
2. UI testing with Cypress or Testing Library
3. Authentication token refresh mechanism
4. Improved error handling and user feedback
5. Optimized file uploads for larger files
