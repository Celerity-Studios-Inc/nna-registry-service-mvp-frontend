# CI/CD #278 Test Checklist (Commit 6ba8dec)

This document provides a structured approach to verify the fixes implemented in the most recent build.

## Build Verification
- [x] CI/CD pipeline completed successfully without TypeScript errors
- [x] All files built and deployed correctly

## 1. Subcategory Selection Test

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Asset Registration page
2. Select any layer (e.g., "S" for Star)
3. Click "Next" to proceed to Step 2
4. Select a category (e.g., "POP" for Popular)
5. Select a subcategory (e.g., "HPM" for Hipster Male)
6. Verify subcategory remains selected
7. Click "Next" to advance to Step 3

### Expected Results:
- Subcategory cards should display in a grid layout (not a vertical column)
- Selected subcategory should remain highlighted after selection
- Selected subcategory data should persist when moving to next step
- No UI freezes or unresponsiveness during the selection process

## 2. Step Navigation Test

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Asset Registration page
2. Double-click a layer card in Step 1
3. Verify you are taken to Step 2 (Choose Taxonomy), not skipped to Step 3

### Expected Results:
- Double-clicking a layer should select it but not skip Step 2
- Step 2 (Choose Taxonomy) should be displayed after double-clicking a layer
- Category cards should be visible immediately without having to click "Retry"

## 3. Form Validation Test

### Test Steps:
1. Complete all steps of asset registration (select layer, category, subcategory, upload file)
2. Intentionally skip one required field (e.g., remove the file)
3. Proceed to Review & Submit
4. Verify error message clearly indicates what's missing

### Expected Results:
- Form validation should show clear error messages
- Missing fields should be clearly indicated
- Selected category and subcategory should display correctly in the review step

## 4. Grid Layout Test

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Asset Registration page and proceed to Step 2
2. Select a category that has multiple subcategories
3. Verify the subcategory display layout

### Expected Results:
- Subcategory cards should display in a grid layout with multiple columns
- Cards should flow horizontally first, then vertically (row-based layout)
- Grid should be responsive to window size changes

## 5. Performance Test

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate through all steps of asset registration
2. Click through layer, category, and subcategory selections rapidly
3. Observe UI responsiveness

### Expected Results:
- UI should respond quickly to all interactions
- No noticeable lag between clicks
- No UI freezes during the selection process

## Notes:
- Document any edge cases or unexpected behavior
- Test on different browsers if possible (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test different layer/category/subcategory combinations
- Pay special attention to the S and W layers which had specific issues
