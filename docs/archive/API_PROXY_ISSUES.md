# API Proxy TypeScript Issues

During deployment, the following TypeScript errors were detected in `api/proxy.ts`:

```
api/proxy.ts(218,30): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
api/proxy.ts(233,22): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
api/proxy.ts(236,22): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
api/proxy.ts(242,22): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
api/proxy.ts(245,22): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
api/proxy.ts(249,59): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'. Did you mean 'Response'?
```

## Issue Analysis

The API proxy file appears to be using an undefined variable `response` instead of the TypeScript `Response` type. These should be fixed to ensure consistent TypeScript typing throughout the API layer.

## Suggested Fix

1. Review all instances of `response` in `api/proxy.ts`
2. Replace references to the undefined variable with the proper variables or types
3. For variable naming, ensure consistent casing (likely `res` or `apiResponse` based on the codebase conventions)

## Next Steps

These issues are non-blocking for the frontend application as they do not prevent the build from completing, but they should be addressed in a future maintenance update to maintain code quality and type safety throughout the codebase.
