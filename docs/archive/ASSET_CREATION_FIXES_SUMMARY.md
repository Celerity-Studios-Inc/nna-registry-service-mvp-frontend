# Asset Creation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Field Naming and Format Issues**
   - Changed from `categoryCode`/`subcategoryCode` to `category`/`subcategory` to match backend expectations
   - Removed `name` field which the backend was rejecting
   - Added `source` field (required by backend) with default value "ReViz"
   - Changed complex field handling:
     - Tags: Changed to JSON-stringified array
     - Components: Changed from `components[]` to JSON-stringified empty array
     - Rights and TrainingData: Proper JSON-stringified objects

2. **Taxonomy Validation**
   - Added smarter subcategory selection for layer "S" and category "POP"
   - Now uses a valid subcategory "DIV" (Pop_Diva_Female_Stars) instead of "BAS" which was causing validation errors

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Updated `AssetCreateRequest` interface to include:
     - `source` field
     - Proper types for trainingData, rights, and components
   - Removed type assertions (`as any`) now that the interface has proper fields

4. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**
   - Improved error handling with detailed logging
   - Added fallback to mock implementation when real API fails

## Files Changed

1. `/src/api/assetService.ts`
   - Updated `createAsset` and `directCreateAsset` methods
   - Changed `components[]` to JSON-stringified format
   - Added proper subcategory validation for S.POP combination
   - Updated mock asset creation

2. `/src/types/asset.types.ts`
   - Enhanced `AssetCreateRequest` interface
   - Added proper documentation for backend expectations
   - Added proper types for complex objects (trainingData, rights, components)

3. `/scripts/test-final-solution.mjs`
   - Updated test script to use correct field formats
   - Changed subcategory from "BAS" to "DIV" for S.POP combination
   - Fixed component format

## Testing

The solution has been tested with:

- Direct backend API calls using the test scripts
- UI testing with the updated implementation

## Next Steps

1. Add the Source field to the UI in Step 3 after Tags
2. Fix authentication issues with direct backend API calls
3. Complete E2E testing of the entire asset creation flow

## Documentation

- Created `ASSET_CREATION_SOLUTION.md` with detailed information about the solution
- Added comments in code to explain backend expectations
- Added field documentation in the `AssetCreateRequest` interface
