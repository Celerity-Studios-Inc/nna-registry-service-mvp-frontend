# Error Boundary Implementation

## Overview

Error Boundaries provide a way to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application. This implementation enhances the base React error boundary concept with additional features specific to our application needs.

## Features

1. **Enhanced Base ErrorBoundary**
   - Function fallbacks that receive error and reset function
   - Component-specific error handling
   - Reset on props change capability
   - Detailed error logging
   - Development-only error details

2. **Specialized TaxonomyErrorBoundary**
   - Taxonomy-specific fallback UI
   - Data reload functionality
   - Integration with logging system
   - Visual error feedback tailored to taxonomy components

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **ErrorBoundary**
   - A class component that extends React.Component
   - Implements React's error boundary lifecycle methods
   - Provides flexible fallback options
   - Includes reset functionality

2. **TaxonomyErrorBoundary**
   - A specialized error boundary for taxonomy components
   - Integrates with the taxonomy systems
   - Provides specific recovery options for taxonomy errors
   - Enhances error reporting with taxonomy context

### How It Works

1. **Error Catching**
   - The error boundary catches errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of components below it in the tree
   - The caught error is stored in state and triggers a re-render with fallback UI

2. **Error Reporting**
   - The error is logged to the application's logging system
   - Additional information like component names and error context is included
   - In development mode, detailed error information is displayed

3. **Recovery Options**
   - Reset functionality allows clearing the error state
   - Props change detection can automatically reset the boundary
   - Specialized boundaries include domain-specific recovery options

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
// Wrap components that might throw errors
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ComponentThatMightThrow />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Custom Fallback UI

```tsx
// Provide a custom fallback UI
<ErrorBoundary
  fallback={<div>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</div>}
>
  <ComponentThatMightThrow />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Function Fallback with Error Information

```tsx
// Use a function fallback that receives the error and reset function
<ErrorBoundary
  fallback={(error, resetError) => (
    <div>
      <h3>Error: {error.message}</h3>
      <button onClick={resetError}>Try Again</button>
    </div>
  )}
>
  <ComponentThatMightThrow />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Taxonomy-Specific Usage

```tsx
// Use the specialized taxonomy error boundary
<TaxonomyErrorBoundary
  onReset={() => console.log('Taxonomy component reset')}
  attemptReload={() => taxonomyService.reloadData()}
>
  <TaxonomyComponent />
</TaxonomyErrorBoundary>
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Taxonomy Selection Flow

The TaxonomyErrorBoundary is integrated at key points in the taxonomy selection flow:

- Around the TaxonomySelector component
- Around individual taxonomy grids (layer, category, subcategory)
- Around the taxonomy data loading processes

### 2. Form Submission

Error boundaries are placed strategically around form submission logic:

- Around the form as a whole
- Around critical parts of the submission process
- Around data validation components

### 3. Application Structure

Error boundaries are layered throughout the application:

- Root-level boundary for catching unhandled errors
- Page-level boundaries for page-specific errors
- Component-level boundaries for isolating component failures

## Testing

The error boundary components are comprehensively tested to ensure:

1. They correctly render children when no errors occur
2. They display the appropriate fallback UI when errors happen
3. Reset functionality works as expected
4. Custom error handlers are properly called
5. Function fallbacks receive the correct error and reset function
6. Recovery mechanisms work across various error scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Placement Strategy**
   - Place error boundaries at strategic points where failures are likely or impactful
   - Use a more granular approach for critical features
   - Consider component responsibilities when deciding boundary placement

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Provide meaningful recovery options when possible
   - Include "try again" functionality for transient errors
   - Offer reload or refresh options for data-related errors

3. **Error Information**
   - Balance usability with technical detail
   - Show user-friendly messages in production
   - Provide detailed technical information in development

4. **Logging**
   - Include contextual information in error logs
   - Group related errors to identify patterns
   - Track recovery attempts and successes

## Next Steps

1. **Telemetry Integration**
   - Add integration with error monitoring services
   - Implement error aggregation and analysis
   - Set up error rate alerts

2. **Enhanced Recovery**
   - Develop automatic retry strategies for network errors
   - Implement staggered retry with exponential backoff
   - Add context-aware recovery suggestions

3. **User Experience**
   - Enhance fallback UIs with more helpful guidance
   - Add progressive disclosure of technical details
   - Implement guided recovery workflows
