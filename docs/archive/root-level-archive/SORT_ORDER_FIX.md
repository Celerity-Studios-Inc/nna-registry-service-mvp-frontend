# Sort Order Fix - Ensuring React State Updates

## Date: June 17, 2025

## Issue Identified
While the Sort By functionality was fixed in commit 260b374, the Order dropdown (A→Z/Z→A, Newest First/Oldest First) was not triggering re-sorts when changed.

## Root Cause
React was not detecting state changes because the sorted array was the same reference. React uses Object.is() comparison for state updates, and sorting an array in-place doesn't create a new reference.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Force New Array Reference
Modified both `handleSortChange` and `handleSortOrderChange` to use spread operator:
```javascript
// Before
setSearchResults(sortedResults);

// After  
setSearchResults([...sortedResults]);
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added console logs to track:
- Sort state changes
- Results count before/after sort
- First few items to verify sort order
- Monitor searchResults state updates

### 3. Key Changes Made
- Line 633: `setSearchResults([...sortedResults]);` in handleSortChange
- Line 652: `setSearchResults([...sortedResults]);` in handleSortOrderChange
- Added useEffect to monitor searchResults changes (lines 119-124)

## Testing Instructions
1. Search for assets (e.g., "startx")
2. Select Sort By: "Created By"
3. Change Order from "A → Z" to "Z → A"
4. Results should re-sort immediately
5. Check console logs for confirmation

## Expected Console Output
```
🔄 Sort order changing to: desc Current sortBy: createdBy
📊 Current results length: 11
🔧 applySortToResults called: {resultCount: 11, sortBy: "createdBy", sortOrder: "desc"}
✅ Sorted results: 11 items
🔍 First few items after sort: [...]
🔍 searchResults updated: 11 items
```

## Technical Details
The spread operator `[...array]` creates a new array with the same elements, forcing React to recognize the state change and trigger a re-render. This is a common pattern when updating arrays in React state.
