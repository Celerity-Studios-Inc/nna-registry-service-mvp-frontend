# Frontend Restoration Summary

This document summarizes the steps taken to restore the frontend to a stable state and configure proper CI/CD deployment.

## Date: May 13, 2025

## Actions Completed

1. **Frontend Code Restoration**
   - Rolled back to working commit 461b17f ("Fix syntax error in taxonomyService.ts")
   - Confirmed the frontend builds successfully after rollback
   - Updated backend URL to point to the correct production endpoint at registry.reviz.dev/api
   - Ensured REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API is set to 'false' in all environment configurations

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Updated `.env.local` to use the production backend
   - Confirmed Vercel.json contains correct environment settings
   - Updated documentation to correct NNA definition (Naming, Numbering, and Addressing)

3. **GitHub Actions and Vercel Integration**
   - Added required Vercel secrets as repository secrets:
     - VERCEL_TOKEN
     - VERCEL_ORG_ID
     - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
   - Successfully triggered GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verified automated deployment to Vercel through GitHub Actions

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated verification guide with detailed steps for testing
   - Added testing documentation with clear instructions for mock/real mode
   - Corrected project documentation (NNA definition, URLs, etc.)

## Current Status

- **Frontend Deployment**: Successfully deployed to https://nna-registry-service-mvp-frontend.vercel.app/
- **Backend Connectivity**: Frontend correctly connects to backend at registry.reviz.dev/api
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow correctly builds and deploys to Vercel
- **Remaining Issue**: Backend subcategory normalization - subcategories are still converted to "Base" (BAS) except for HPM

## Testing Results

Initial testing shows the frontend is functioning as expected:
- Asset registration works correctly
- UI displays properly
- Backend connectivity is verified
- Authentication works properly

However, the backend subcategory normalization issue remains - when selecting a subcategory like LGM (Legend Male), the backend returns BAS (Base). This is a backend issue that needs to be addressed separately.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Deployment**: Confirm the latest deployment functions correctly
2. **Test with Updated Backend**: Connect to the updated backend to verify subcategory normalization fixes
3. **Further Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation as needed

---

This restoration effort has successfully returned the frontend to a stable state and established proper CI/CD deployment processes. The application is now ready for further testing with the updated backend to verify subcategory normalization fixes.
