# State Synchronization Fix for Taxonomy Selection

## Issue

Users couldn't select a category after selecting a layer in the taxonomy selection workflow. The console was showing errors indicating that the `selectedLayer` remained null despite being set via `setSelectedLayer()`.

## Root Cause

React's state updates via `useState` happen asynchronously and in batches. When we called `setSelectedLayer()` and then immediately tried to use the updated `selectedLayer` value, we were still getting the old value (null). This cascaded into failures throughout the taxonomy selection workflow.

## Solution

1. Added `useRef` to track current state values synchronously
2. Updated refs immediately before state updates for synchronous access
3. Modified selection functions to use refs for current values
4. Implemented proactive data loading to avoid state batching delays
5. Enhanced logging and verification for better debugging

## Key Code Changes

```typescript
// Before
const [selectedLayer, setSelectedLayer] = useState<string | null>(null);

const selectLayer = useCallback((layer: string) => {
  setSelectedLayer(layer);
  // The problem: selectedLayer is still null here!
}, []);

// After
const [selectedLayer, setSelectedLayer] = useState<string | null>(null);
const selectedLayerRef = useRef<string | null>(selectedLayer);

// Keep ref in sync with state
useEffect(() => {
  selectedLayerRef.current = selectedLayer;
}, [selectedLayer]);

const selectLayer = useCallback((layer: string) => {
  // Update ref immediately - this is synchronous
  selectedLayerRef.current = layer;
  
  // Then update state
  setSelectedLayer(layer);
  
  // Proactively load data using the ref
  if (autoLoad) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (selectedLayerRef.current === layer) {
        loadCategories(layer);
      }
    }, 0);
  }
}, []);
```

## Results

The fix has been implemented and tested. The taxonomy selection workflow now works as expected:

1. Users can select a layer (layer names display correctly)
2. After selecting a layer, categories load and display correctly
3. Users can select a category from the loaded categories
4. Subcategories load and display correctly after category selection

This fix addresses the underlying state synchronization issues without requiring extensive refactoring of other components.
