# Taxonomy Import Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

1. **Missing module import error in TaxonomySelection.tsx**
   - Problem: The component was importing from non-existent "../../api/taxonomyMapper"
   - Solution: Updated import to "../../api/taxonomyMapper.enhanced" which contains the required functionality
   - Affected file: src/components/asset/TaxonomySelection.tsx

2. **Type mismatch in DropdownBasedTaxonomySelector.tsx**
   - Problem: TaxonomyItem[] was not assignable to CategoryOption[] due to missing 'id' field
   - Solution: Added mapping function to transform TaxonomyItems to CategoryOptions with all required fields
   - Affected file: src/components/taxonomy/DropdownBasedTaxonomySelector.tsx

3. **Event handler type incompatibility with Material UI**
   - Problem: React.ChangeEvent<{ value: unknown }> was not compatible with MUI's SelectChangeEvent
   - Solution: Updated event handler types to use SelectChangeEvent from '@mui/material/Select'
   - Affected file: src/components/taxonomy/DropdownTaxonomySelector.tsx

4. **Missing taxonomy service methods**
   - Problem: The component was calling methods that didn't exist on the taxonomyService
   - Solution: Created fallback implementations for getAvailableLayers, getLayerName, and getLayerNumericCode
   - Affected file: src/components/taxonomy/DropdownTaxonomySelector.tsx

5. **Missing taxonomyMapper in RegisterAssetPage.tsx**
   - Problem: The page was importing from non-existent "../api/taxonomyMapper"
   - Solution: Updated import to "../api/taxonomyMapper.enhanced"
   - Affected file: src/pages/RegisterAssetPage.tsx

## Verification

The build now completes successfully with only ESLint warnings (no errors). The build output is in the "build" directory and should be deployable to Vercel or other hosting services.

## Next Steps

1. Compare the current UI with CI/CD #139 (Commit 3521e3f) to verify appearance is maintained
2. Address ESLint warnings if needed (though they don't affect functionality)
3. Consider adding proper type definitions for taxonomy services to avoid similar issues in the future
