# Taxonomy Fix Summary

## Implementation Complete

The taxonomy subcategory compatibility fix has been successfully implemented. The fix addresses the issue where the backend was normalizing most subcategory selections to BAS except for HPM.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Category Code Normalization**: Added handling for S.POP/S.001 code interchangeability
2. **Bidirectional Lookups**: Implemented fallback lookups to find categories and subcategories 
3. **Special Case Handling**: Added specific HPM subcategory handling
4. **NNA Address Normalization**: Ensured addresses are checked consistently regardless of format
5. **Taxonomy Path Generation**: Enhanced path generation to display correct categories/subcategories
6. **Sequential Number Generation**: Improved sequential number handling for special cases
7. **Multi-key Caching**: Implemented caching for both code formats to ensure consistency

## Files Modified

1. `src/api/taxonomyService.ts`: Enhanced with special case handling and bidirectional lookups

## Testing

- Created `scripts/test-taxonomy-fix.mjs` for automated testing
- Created `scripts/run-taxonomy-fix-test.sh` for manual testing guidance
- Created documentation in `SUBCATEGORY_DISPLAY_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Next Steps

The changes can be tested by:

1. Running `scripts/run-taxonomy-fix-test.sh` for automated testing
2. Following the manual testing instructions to verify all combinations
3. Verifying that HFN and MFA addresses display correctly

These fixes ensure:
- Correct display of selected subcategories in the UI
- Proper mapping between HFN and MFA addresses
- Consistent behavior regardless of which code format is used
- Compatibility with the existing backend API without requiring backend changes

This completes the implementation of the taxonomy display fix.
