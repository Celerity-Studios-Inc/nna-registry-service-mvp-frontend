# NNA Registry Service Frontend Deployment Summary

## Changes Made

We've successfully implemented several improvements to fix the API connection issues and enhance the deployment process:

1. **Fixed API Connectivity Issue**
   - Added environment variable debugging tools
   - Enhanced API proxy with detailed logging
   - Implemented a domain check to force real API usage on production domains
   - Created documentation in `API_PROXY_DEBUG.md`

2. **Improved Deployment Process**
   - Created a build test workflow that doesn't require Vercel secrets
   - Improved GitHub Secrets setup guide with direct links and clearer instructions
   - Added a manual deployment guide as a fallback option

## Current Status

1. **Code Changes**:
   ✅ All code changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
   ✅ The application should now correctly use the real backend API in production

2. **GitHub Actions Deployment**:
   ❌ The main deployment workflow is failing due to missing Vercel secrets
   ✅ The build test workflow should run successfully (code builds without errors)

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment process, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up GitHub Secrets for Vercel**
   - Follow the instructions in `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
   - Get your Vercel token, organization ID, and project ID
   - Add these as secrets to the GitHub repository

2. **Trigger the Deployment Workflow**
   - Create an empty commit or manually trigger the workflow as described in the guide
   - Verify the workflow completes successfully

3. **Alternative: Manual Deployment**
   - If GitHub Actions continues to fail, use the manual deployment process
   - Follow the instructions in `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md`

4. **Verify the Deployment**
   - Follow the verification steps in `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`
   - Check that the application is using the real API
   - Test by registering a new asset

## Resources

- GitHub Actions Workflows: https://github.com/EqualsAjayMadhok/nna-registry-service-mvp-frontend/actions
- Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Deployed Application: https://registry-service-frontend.vercel.app

## Local Testing

You can verify the API integration locally by running:

```bash
# Set up environment
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=/api" > .env.production
echo "REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=false" >> .env.production

# Build and serve
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

Then check the browser console to confirm the environment variables are correctly set.
