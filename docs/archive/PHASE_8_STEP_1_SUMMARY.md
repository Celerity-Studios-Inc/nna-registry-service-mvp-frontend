# Phase 8, Step 1: Remove Feature Toggle - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Step 1 (Remove Feature Toggle) of Phase 8 (Final Cleanup and Rollout) for the taxonomy refactoring project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Component Files
- `RegisterAssetPageWrapper.tsx`: Removed conditional rendering based on UI version and updated to always use the new implementation
- `App.tsx`: Removed imports and references to UIVersionToggle component
- `TaxonomySelectorTestPage.tsx`: Removed UI version toggle functionality and references, and updated description to reflect that the new implementation is used

### 2. Removed Files
- Deleted `UIVersionToggle.tsx` component
- Deleted `featureToggle.ts` utility
- Deleted `UIVersionToggle.css` stylesheet

### 3. Updated Test Files
- `test-critical-cases.html`: Removed UI version toggle UI and related JavaScript code

## Implementation Details

### RegisterAssetPageWrapper.tsx
The wrapper component now directly renders the new implementation without any conditional logic:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Box } from '@mui/material';
import RegisterAssetPageNew from '../../pages/new/RegisterAssetPageNew';

/**
 * Wrapper component that renders the new RegisterAssetPage implementation
 * This component previously switched between old and new implementations,
 * but now solely uses the new implementation after feature toggle removal.
 */
const RegisterAssetPageWrapper: React.FC = () => {
  // Log for context
  console.log('[RegisterAssetPageWrapper] Using new implementation');

  return (
    <Box position="relative">
      <RegisterAssetPageNew />
    </Box>
  );
};

export default RegisterAssetPageWrapper;
```

### Removal of Feature Toggle System
The feature toggle system previously provided:
- UI toggle component that appeared in the bottom right of the page
- URL parameter handling for `uiVersion`
- localStorage persistence for UI version preference
- Utility functions for managing and checking UI version

All of these elements have been completely removed, ensuring that the new implementation is the only option.

## Next Steps
The next step in the cleanup process is Step 2: Clean Up Old Implementation, which will involve:
- Removing the original RegisterAssetPage component
- Cleaning up any legacy taxonomy selection components
- Removing special case handling methods
- Fixing imports throughout the codebase

## Benefits
- Simplified codebase with less conditional logic
- Reduced bundle size by removing unused code
- Clearer component hierarchy without toggle-related complexity
- Improved maintainability by standardizing on a single implementation
