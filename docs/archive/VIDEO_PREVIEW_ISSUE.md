# Video Preview Issue

## Problem Statement

Video previews in the asset registration and display flow are not consistently rendered across different screens.

## Observations

- Video thumbnails display inconsistently across different components (upload, review, success screens)
- Some videos may not generate proper thumbnails
- Video playback may have different behavior depending on browser and device

## Potential Solutions

### Short-term fixes

1. **Consistent Thumbnail Generation**
   - Generate consistent thumbnail images for videos at upload time
   - Store these thumbnails alongside the video asset
   - Display the thumbnail image instead of trying to render the video inline

2. **Better Fallback Display**
   - Implement a more consistent fallback display when video previews can't be generated
   - Use a standardized video icon with play button overlay
   - Show video metadata (duration, size, format) more prominently

### Long-term improvements

1. **Video Processing Service**
   - Implement server-side video processing to generate thumbnails
   - Create multiple resolution versions for optimal playback
   - Extract metadata (duration, codecs, dimensions) for better display

2. **Media Player Enhancement**
   - Improve the integrated media player with better controls
   - Add support for different video formats
   - Implement adaptive streaming capabilities

## Implementation Priority

This issue should be addressed after the Search Assets functionality is implemented, as search is a higher priority feature.

## Related Components

- `FilePreview.tsx` - Needs enhancement for better video handling
- `MediaPlayer.tsx` - Could be improved with better video controls and fallbacks
- `RegisterAssetPage.tsx` - Video preview logic during asset creation
- `AssetDetailPage.tsx` - Video display in asset details

## Notes for Future Implementation

When implementing a fix, consider:
1. Browser compatibility differences
2. Performance impact of video loading
3. Mobile vs desktop experiences
4. Accessibility requirements for video content
