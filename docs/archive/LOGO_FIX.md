# Logo Files Fix

## Issue

The console was displaying the following error:

```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: 
https://registry-service-frontend.vercel.app/logo192.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
```

## Root Cause

Upon investigation, the error was caused by empty (0-byte) image files:
- `/public/logo192.png` was empty
- `/public/logo512.png` was empty
- `/public/logo.png` was empty

This means the files existed but contained no data, causing the browser to fail when trying to load them for the PWA manifest.

## Solution

1. Copied valid logo files from the reference implementation:
   - Copied `/nna-registry-service-frontend-reference/public/logo192.png` → `/nna-registry-service-mvp-frontend/public/logo192.png`
   - Copied `/nna-registry-service-frontend-reference/public/logo512.png` → `/nna-registry-service-mvp-frontend/public/logo512.png`

2. Updated the application name in the manifest.json file:
   - Changed "short_name" from "React App" to "NNA Registry"
   - Changed "name" from "Create React App Sample" to "NNA Registry Service"

3. Verified the favicon.ico file was valid and working

4. Created a test page (logo-test.html) to verify the images load correctly

## Verification

The error should no longer appear in the console when the application is loaded. A simple way to verify this fix is to:

1. Build the application with `npm run build`
2. Deploy or serve the build folder
3. Inspect the console for any logo-related errors

You can also directly load `logo-test.html` to visually verify the logos.

## Additional Notes

- The manifest.json file already had the correct references to the logo files
- The favicon.ico file was already valid and correctly referenced
- The fix should eliminate the manifest icon errors in the console
